# trails — Claude guide

The rules and conventions for working in this repo. For the Rails-port
methodology — working principles, the `@internal` JSDoc convention, and how to
measure progress — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). For project overview,
package list, and the `declare` / associations / enums / schema reference, see
[README.md](README.md).

## Fidelity is the job

trails is a re-implementation of Rails, not a library inspired by it. When a
file has a Rails counterpart, write it as close to the Ruby as TypeScript
allows. The bar is **"would a Rails dev recognize this as the same method"** —
not "does it pass the tests."

Mirror, method by method and line by line:

- **Names.** Method, class, module, constant, and field names come from Rails,
  translated by the rules in
  [docs/ruby-ts-conventions.md](docs/ruby-ts-conventions.md) — that file is
  generated from `scripts/parity/conventions.ts` and is what `parity:api`
  actually matches on, so read it _before_ you pick a name, not after CI
  disagrees. It also covers file paths (`PATH_SEGMENT_ALIASES`,
  `RUBY_FILE_TS_OVERRIDES`). If your name isn't the one that table produces
  from the Ruby name, you have a bug, not a preference.
- **Locals and parameters.** A local or parameter keeps the Rails identifier,
  camelCased — Ruby `stmt` is `stmt`, not `statement`; `klass` is `klass`, not
  `modelClass`. Same for parameter _order_ and defaults. This is free fidelity
  and it is most of what makes a body readable next to the Ruby.
- **Control flow.** Same branches, in the same order, with the same guards and
  early returns. Do not collapse two Rails branches into one, invert a guard,
  reorder side-effect-free calls, or drop a check you believe is unreachable.
- **Decomposition.** If Rails extracts a private helper, extract it, with the
  Rails name. If Rails inlines something, inline it. One Rails method is one TS
  method.
- **No extra abstraction.** Do not add a helper, wrapper, indirection layer, or
  "cleaner" rewrite that Rails does not have. Extra surface is measured —
  `pnpm parity:api:extra` reports every public TS name with no Ruby counterpart. If
  you genuinely need one, declare it with a `@noRailsEquivalent` JSDoc tag; that
  tag is the only sanctioned exception. A receipt has exactly two shapes and
  carries no prose: `PERMANENT`, where the token is the whole receipt, and
  `CONVERGEABLE <story-id>`, where the story IS the receipt and the tag only
  points at it. `no-freeform-comments` strips anything else.
- **Errors.** Same error class, same message string, same raise site.

**Only a genuine TypeScript language shortcoming can justify a deviation** —
and even then, converge the shape as far as the language allows and keep the
Rails name. There is almost always a way around:

- Ruby `x=` that must be async → keep the Rails name in a `setX()` method
  rather than renaming the concept (a TS `set` accessor can't be awaited).
- Ruby `include SomeModule` → `include()` / `Included<>` from
  `@blazetrails/activesupport`, or `this`-typed functions assigned to the class
  (see "Module mixins" below), so the code still lives in the Rails file at the
  Rails name.
- Ruby kwargs, blocks, and `method_missing` each have a settled trails idiom.
  Find it and use it; don't invent a new shape.

"TypeScript can't do this" is a claim you have to actually try to disprove
first. Deviation from Rails is almost always wrong; matching Rails is almost
always right. Every deviation you do ship is justified **at the call site**,
not in the PR body.

### A documented deviation is debt, not permission

Convergence is the goal. Every deviation register in this repo — the
`call-mismatches-exclude` baselines, `arity-exclude.json`, `@noRailsEquivalent`,
`@missingRailsCall`, `SKIP_GROUPS`, and every story in a
`<package>-surfaced-deviations` bucket — is a **burndown ledger**, not a settled
decision. A row in one of them says "we know this is wrong and haven't fixed it yet." It is
never a licence to leave it, to copy the pattern into new code, or to add a
sibling row next to it.

So:

- **Finding an existing deviation next to your work is a reason to converge it,
  not to match it.** If it's out of scope for your PR, file it
  (`pnpm tasks new <rfc> <slug> --body-file <path>`) with the Rails `file:line`
  you already have in front of you. Do not silently propagate the shape.
- **A deviation-convergence story always converges.** Do not close one by
  writing a better justification for the deviation, by broadening a baseline
  reason, or by moving it to a different register. If it genuinely cannot
  converge, `pnpm tasks block` it with the specific blocker — but that is rare,
  and "it would be a bigger diff" is not one.
- **Never widen an allowlist to cover new work.** Baselines are only-shrink by
  construction; adding a row for code you are writing right now inverts the
  entire mechanism.
- **Only a genuine TypeScript language shortcoming is ratifiable**, and only
  after you have tried the settled workaround above. "Cleaner in TS", "more
  idiomatic", "the tests pass either way", and "this is how the rest of the file
  does it" are not language shortcomings.

### Ruby idioms that do not translate literally

These are the recurring silent-divergence traps. Check each one whenever you
port a body:

- **Truthiness.** Ruby's `if x` is false only for `nil`/`false`. `Boolean(x)`
  and `if (x)` are also false for `0`, `""`, and `NaN`. Port `if x` as
  `x != null && x !== false` — or just `x != null` once you have checked the
  value can't be a boolean — never as a bare truthiness test unless you have
  checked it can't be `0`/`""` either.
- **`fetch` vs `??`.** `h.fetch(:k, default)` returns the _stored_ value
  whenever the key exists — including a stored `nil` or `false`. `h.k ?? default`
  substitutes the default for `null`/`undefined`. They differ, and Rails
  relation readers depend on the difference.
- **`present?` / `blank?` / `presence`.** Use the ActiveSupport analogues, not
  `!!x` or `x?.length`. `" "` is blank in Ruby and truthy in JS.
- **kwargs.** A TS default parameter swallows an explicitly-passed `undefined`,
  so a caller forwarding an absent kwarg silently gets the default where Ruby
  would have seen `nil`. Match Ruby's kwarg semantics explicitly when it matters.
- **Predicates.** A Ruby predicate returns a value, not necessarily a boolean;
  a value-returning predicate ported as a `boolean` breaks every call site that
  used the value.
- **Bang methods** raise; the non-bang form returns falsy. Port both arms.
- **Symbols vs strings.** Where Rails accepts a Symbol _or_ a String, port both
  arms — dropping the string arm is a common silent gap.
- **A Ruby Symbol is a JS string, never a JS `Symbol`.** `:short` is `"short"`.
  JS `Symbol` / `Symbol.for` is reserved for private keys and brands — using it
  to model a Ruby Symbol value puts a type in the port that Rails devs don't
  read as a Symbol and that no other package uses. Where a method's control
  flow turns on `Symbol === x` (a Symbol meaning "look this up" against a
  String meaning "use this literally" — `I18n::Backend::Base#localize`'s
  `format`, a `:default` that names another key), keep the Symbol's leading
  colon in the string: `":short"`, and `.slice(1)` for its name. The colon is
  the discriminator Ruby gets from the type, and it is how the value already
  renders through `inspect`.

If you find a new instance, file it against the best-fit active RFC, else the
`<package>-surfaced-deviations` bucket for the package it is about — one exists
per package (`pnpm tasks list | grep surfaced-deviations`), and
`0023-surfaced-deviations` is retired as the catch-all, so do not file there.
RFC `0082-ruby-ts-idiom-conversion-classes` in the tasks repo enumerates these
as convergence classes.

## Bugs found from an application land here

trailmap (`blazetrailsdev/trailmap`) is the first real application built on
trails, and it consumes the framework as committed tarballs rather than a
workspace link. When it hits a framework bug, **the fix belongs here**, in the
package that owns the behaviour, with a test here — the application then picks
it up by re-vendoring. trailmap's own CLAUDE.md carries the matching rule from
its side, and an application-side workaround is a defect in its own right.

Two things follow for you, receiving such a report:

- **The reproduction usually arrives in application terms** ("a helper method
  is not defined in a view"). Reduce it to the framework behaviour and write
  the test at that level, in the package's own suite. A test that boots an
  application to prove a `Proxy` trap is missing is the wrong altitude — though
  a single end-to-end test through `packages/trailties/src/__fixtures__/boot-app`
  is a fair way to prove the whole chain reconnects.
- **Do not trust a report's claim about what the framework does.** The tarballs
  the app runs on can be behind `main`, and behind whatever `vendor/TRAILS_PIN`
  claims: the `app/helpers` report (#7558) described an `ActionView::Base.withHelpers`
  that had already been removed from `main` by #7390, which had moved
  view-context construction onto the controller. Check `main` before believing
  a bug is unfixed, and before believing it is.

## Working in this repo

- Do use worktrees for any changes; leave the default worktree for the user.
  Always use `scripts/start-worktree.sh` to start a worktree.
- **The Rails source of truth is vendored at `vendor/rails/`** (populated in
  every worktree by `start-worktree.sh`; refresh with `pnpm vendor:fetch` from
  the main worktree). Before porting or fixing anything, read the
  corresponding Rails code and test there — e.g.
  `vendor/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/...` and
  `vendor/rails/activerecord/test/cases/...`. The canonical test schema is
  `vendor/rails/activerecord/test/schema/schema.rb`, which
  `packages/activerecord/src/test-helpers/test-schema.ts` mirrors — when a
  test needs a table or column, check schema.rb first; if it's not there,
  don't invent it. Likewise, Rails' test models live in
  `vendor/rails/activerecord/test/models/` (ours:
  `packages/activerecord/src/test-helpers/models/`) and its fixture data in
  `vendor/rails/activerecord/test/fixtures/` (ours:
  `packages/activerecord/src/test-helpers/fixtures/`) — mirror those too
  rather than making up models or fixture rows.
- To map a trails test name or method/constant to its vendored Rails
  `file:line` instead of hand-grepping, run `pnpm rails:find <query>` — it
  reuses the test-compare / api-compare manifests and falls back to a scoped
  grep of `vendor/rails/activerecord/`, tagging each result with the mode.
- Two reference tables answer "what do I call this?" without guessing, and both
  are CI-verified current:
  **[docs/ruby-ts-conventions.md](docs/ruby-ts-conventions.md)** for the
  Ruby→TS name and file-path translations `parity:api` matches on (generated
  from `scripts/parity/conventions.ts` — change the rule there, never
  hand-edit the doc), and `SKIP_GROUPS` / `SCOPED_SKIP_GROUPS` in that same
  source file for the members deliberately not mirrored, each with its reason.
  If you think a Ruby name has no reasonable TS spelling, check `SKIP_GROUPS`
  before inventing one.
- Do NOT use subagents unless explicitly requested.
- **AR work tracking lives in the `tasks` repo, not in docs.** Pick work via
  `pnpm tasks` (`ready` / `next-bundle` / `claim`) — never by hand-editing an
  `activerecord` plan doc, and never by hand-editing a story's `status:` or
  `pr:` (see "Task state vs. task prose" below — that edit does nothing and
  fails CI). `docs/activerecord/` is frozen (RFC 0011 Phase 4);
  CI's `Docs ActiveRecord Freeze` job fails any PR that adds or modifies a
  file there (allowlist: `docs/activerecord/parity-verification.md`). Other
  `docs/` trees are not policed and stay live until their own cutover.
- **The `tasks` CLI itself lives in the tasks repo** (`src/cli.ts`, entered
  through its `bin/tasks`). trails' `pnpm tasks` is a shim,
  `scripts/tasks/tasks.sh`, that finds a tasks checkout and hands off; it does
  not set `$TASKS_DIR`, so the CLI still resolves the working tree it acts on
  from your cwd — your worktree's own `tasks/` symlink. `tasks` is also on the
  `PATH` (installed by `start-worktree.sh`) and works from any cwd. Fix CLI
  bugs in the tasks repo, not here.
- Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By" lines to commits or "Generated with Claude
  Code" lines to PR descriptions.
- After opening a PR, run the `/link` skill with the PR number so webhook
  notifications (reviews, CI failures) are delivered to this pane. Reviews
  land at `~/.btwhooks/data/github/blazetrailsdev/trails/$PR`.
- **Do NOT poll for CI results.** Once `/link` is run, CI outcomes arrive
  automatically via the webhook when the run finishes — no `gh pr checks`
  watch loops, no repeated `gh run` polling, no sleeping-and-rechecking
  (it just wastes turns). The webhook reports failures only: if the run fails
  a notification lands here, so no notification means CI passed. Move on after
  linking — don't wait around watching for a result.
- **Do NOT run the whole test suite locally** (`pnpm test`, `pnpm -r test`,
  `pnpm --filter activerecord test`, etc.). CI runs the full suite on every
  push. Locally, run only the individual test files or small groups you
  touched: `pnpm vitest run path/to/file.test.ts` or
  `pnpm vitest run -t "specific test name"`. The full AR suite forks 6
  workers per invocation; multiple parallel agents running it concurrently
  saturate the host (load avg 100+).

### Task state vs. task prose

The tasks repo is a **SQLite database plus markdown**, not git-as-database. A
story's _prose and structure_ live in the `.md` file and change by PR; a story's
_state_ lives in the DB and changes only through a `tasks` verb. Every
frontmatter field has exactly one authority, and the two sets are disjoint —
which is why `tasks ingest` (git → DB) and `tasks export` (DB → git) can both
run without ever fighting over a field.

| Owner        | Fields                                                                                       | Changed by                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Markdown** | `title`, `rfc`, `cluster`, `deps`, `deps-rfc`, `est-loc`, `priority`, `packages`, body prose | edit the file, open a PR       |
| **Database** | `status`, `pr`, `claim`, `assignee`, `blocked-by`, `closed-reason`, `updated`                | a `tasks` verb — never by hand |

Two rules of thumb cover every field, including ones this table forgets:

- **Rewriting what the work IS** — retitling, resizing `est-loc`, adding a
  dependency, rewriting acceptance criteria — is a markdown edit. Edit the file,
  commit, open a PR; ingest picks it up when the PR merges.
- **Recording what HAPPENED to the work** — claimed, in progress, done, blocked,
  closed — is a verb: `tasks claim <id>` (`--assignee <name>` for `assignee`),
  `tasks in-progress <id> --pr N`, `tasks done <id> --pr N`,
  `tasks block <id> <reason>`, `tasks close <id> <reason>`,
  `tasks status-set <id> <status>` for anything else. `updated` is stamped by
  whichever verb you ran.

**Hand-editing a DB-owned field is the one failure worth spelling out**, because
it is silent rather than loud: ingest skips DB-owned columns by design, so
`status: done` typed into a story file reads correctly to a human, merges
cleanly, and marks nothing done. The tasks repo's CI runs an owned-fields guard
that turns that into a red naming the verb to use instead — but the rule is the
point, not the guard, and the guard only judges stories your PR _modified_.

Two traps follow from the DB being a real, _shared_ database:

- **`tasks ingest` is a sync verb, not an inspection verb.** It publishes what
  is on your branch into the shared DB. Do not reach for it to check that a
  branch's stories parse — that is `pnpm tasks show` / `pnpm tasks list` /
  `pnpm validate`. Running ingest from a worktree published 10 unmerged stories
  into the shared DB once already.
- **A worktree's `.git` is a pointer file into the main checkout**, so the
  `.git/tasks.db` your worktree resolves IS the shared database — every other
  agent reads and writes the same rows. Gitignored does not mean local.

**Creating a story is authoring, so it is markdown**: `pnpm tasks new <rfc>
<slug> --body-file <path>` writes the file, commits it, and ingests it to create
the row. Do not insert a row any other way. The `status:` in a _brand-new_ file
is honored as a birth seed on insert only and ignored by every later ingest — a
seed value, not a sync value, which is why the CI guard judges modified stories
and not added ones.

## Conventions

- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Tests live next to source files as `*.test.ts`.
- Prefer small, focused modules.
- **PR size ceiling: the LOC number stated in your task prompt's "Hard rules"
  block** — that block is the single source of truth (btwhooks fills it from
  `PR_MAX_LOC`, so the number can be retuned without editing this file). Working
  without such a prompt? Keep the PR small and ask before opening a big one.
  Counted as additions + deletions, excluding lockfiles, snapshots, and
  generated parity fixtures; docs-only changes — `.md` files, READMEs, RFC/story
  prose — are exempt. Check before opening with
  `git diff --shortstat origin/main...HEAD -- ':!**/pnpm-lock.yaml' ':!**/__snapshots__/**' ':!**/*.md'`
  (`.md` files are excluded because docs-only changes are exempt; subtract them
  manually if your PR mixes code and docs).
  Tests and fixtures count. The historical 20-method rule is a soft guide; the
  prompt's LOC ceiling is the hard one — review-cycle data shows PRs ≥400 LOC
  need 4–6 rounds minimum and ≥700 LOC need 13+, which is the band the ceiling
  is tuned within. **Do NOT fan out into
  sibling PRs yourself.** Keep each PR scoped to the single story you claimed;
  ship the portion that fits and register the rest as new stories. If the work
  is larger than one PR, or you discover additional work that belongs in a
  separate PR, do NOT open it yourself — add a new story to the epic with
  `pnpm tasks new <rfc-slug> <story-slug> --body-file <path>` so it gets
  scheduled and owned separately. **Capture the context you have right now:**
  `tasks new` refuses an empty/skeleton-only body, so pass `--body-file` with
  the `## Context` (the trails/Rails `file:line` you just read) and
  `## Acceptance criteria` — a title-only stub forces an expensive re-derivation
  later. (`--allow-empty` exists as an escape hatch but avoid it: the bare
  placeholder it creates is exactly the debt this rule and the guard prevent.)
  This keeps the one-agent-per-PR ownership model intact (a single
  agent fanning out N PRs and then dying orphans all of them — this happened).
  The only exception is a single mechanical rename — note it in the PR body.
- **Do NOT stack PRs.** Each PR branches from `main` and stands alone.
  We don't have spare CI runners or review bandwidth — stacked branches
  (`<base>b` off `<base>`, `<base>c` off `<base>b`, etc.) re-run CI on
  every parent rebase and force the reviewer to re-review the same
  diff multiple times. They also produce file-overlap conflicts with
  sibling agents working in parallel. If a feature needs splitting,
  open each split PR from `main` with **non-overlapping files**; if
  true ordering is required, ship the first PR, wait for merge, then
  open the next from updated `main`.
- Open new PRs in **draft** status.
- Do NOT reply to PR comments — replies are invisible to reviewers. Address
  feedback via code changes or PR description edits instead, or discuss with
  the user in conversation.
- Do NOT add code comments that just describe what a line does. Only add
  comments for non-obvious context (hidden bug, broader invariant, etc.).
- Do NOT add empty stubs or placeholder interfaces. If a feature isn't
  implemented yet, don't create an empty file for it.
- **NEVER rename or reword test names.** Test names are how `parity:test`
  matches our tests to Rails tests. If a test fails or the behavior doesn't
  match the name, fix the implementation — not the name. Read the
  corresponding Rails test first. The one thing that does change is the token
  renames in [docs/ruby-ts-conventions.md](docs/ruby-ts-conventions.md), which
  apply to test names too — trails spells `tse`, never `erb`, everywhere,
  including inside a `describe`/`it` string. Rails'
  `test "ERB::Util.html_escape should escape unsafe characters"` is
  `it("TSE::Util.html_escape should escape unsafe characters")`; `parity:test`
  normalizes both sides, so the renamed name still credits. `ERB` survives only
  where the text quotes the Ruby side (a `Mirrors:` JSDoc line, a Rails path).
- **Canonical tables only — no bespoke tables.** In AR tests, get the canonical
  schema + fixtures through `fixtures({ ... })` (the endgame surface: one call
  wires the handler, transactional fixtures, and the canonical schema); never
  re-declare a table inline or invent a free table name. For lower-level setup,
  the canonical loader (`loadCanonicalSchema` in `support/canonical-schema.ts`)
  lays the schema directly. Use the official
  models in `packages/activerecord/src/test-helpers/models/`. Table, column, and
  model names must match Rails exactly. If a test needs something the canonical
  schema lacks, add it to the canonical schema — do not reach for a bespoke
  schema. (`defineSchema` is the retired trails invention being removed by RFC
  0059; don't reach for it in new tests.)

## Before you open the PR

Run these in order. All of them are fast next to a review round, and each one
catches a class of drift a reviewer would otherwise spend a cycle on.

The compare tools live under the `parity:*` script namespace — `parity:api`,
`parity:test`, `parity:fixtures`, `parity:schema`, plus their sub-commands
(`parity:api:calls`, `parity:api:extra`, `parity:test:assertions`, …). The
older `api:*` / `test:compare` / `test:assertions:*` aliases are deprecated and
undocumented: they still delegate so a stale prompt or a muscle-memory
invocation keeps working, but they are scheduled for deletion. Never spell one
in a doc, a comment, a script, or a CI step — `parity:*` is the only name to
write.

1. **Size.**
   `git diff --shortstat origin/main...HEAD -- ':!**/pnpm-lock.yaml' ':!**/__snapshots__/**' ':!**/*.md'`
   — compare against the LOC ceiling in your prompt's "Hard rules" block (see
   Conventions).
2. **Did you touch a ported method body?** If yes, run the call-parity gate.
   It detects the highest-frequency fidelity miss in this repo: a TS body that
   omits a call the Rails body makes — a dropped delegation, an inlined helper,
   an invented shortcut.

   ```bash
   pnpm parity:api:calls   # the call-set ratchet (RFC 0047)
   ```

   The lint reads an artifact on disk and regenerates it first, so a plain
   gating run is enough — gating a stale artifact reports movement that never
   happened, which is how a sibling PR's deleted method surfaces as a STALE row
   on a branch that never touched it. `compare.ts` writes
   `call-mismatches.json` only under `--calls`, so if you need to
   force past a warm cache (it under-reports vs CI):

   ```bash
   API_COMPARE_FORCE=1 pnpm parity:api --calls
   ```

   (RFC 0084 folded the narrow RFC 0044 ratchet — a second gate over its own
   artifact — into this one, whose population subsumed it. There is one
   artifact and one baseline now, and since the rename one `parity:api:calls` script.)

   **New mismatch?** The right fix is almost always to make the TS body call
   what Rails calls. Baselining is the fallback, and it costs a reviewed
   one-line `reason` for the row **you** add — never leave the seeded
   placeholder there. But the debt metric for this baseline is the **row
   count**, not the unreviewed-reason count: rows converge by deletion, and
   inherited seed strings in rows your PR did not add are not yours to
   wordsmith and are not grounds to block a PR (RFC 0084; see
   [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#row-count-is-the-debt-metric-the-unreviewed-count-is-not)). A single justified omission can also carry a `@missingRailsCall`
   JSDoc tag at the call site instead.

   **Converged something?** The baseline is **only-shrink**: fixing a real
   divergence makes its baseline row stale and turns the gate red. Delete that
   one row by hand. Do **not** `--write`/reseed — a reseed rewrites the whole
   exclude tree and buries the one row you meant to retire in an unreviewable
   diff.

   Deleting the row lowers that source's unreviewed count below its committed
   high-water mark, so the gate then reports a **STALE high-water mark**. The
   remedy for that is narrow, not a reseed:

   ```bash
   pnpm parity:api:calls:tighten <package>/<tsFile .ts→.json>   # e.g. activerecord/insert-all.json
   pnpm parity:api:calls:tighten                                # every stale shard
   ```

   It rewrites only the named mark shards — never the exclude tree, never a
   shard you did not converge. `parity:api:calls:reseed` remains for a genuine
   reseed and is not the answer here.

   **Also run the call-ARGUMENT gate**, which the call-set one cannot see past
   — a body that calls what Rails calls, with a different argument list, is
   green on `parity:api:calls`:

   ```bash
   pnpm parity:api:calls:args   # the call-argument ratchet (RFC 0095)
   ```

   Same only-shrink contract, same no-reseed rule, over the SAME
   `call-mismatches-exclude/` shards — its rows carry `kind: "args"` and the
   argument list in the key, and each gate reads only its own kind. It gates
   `shape` rows — count, order, literal values, kwarg keys; `naming` rows (a
   `ref:` identifier spelled differently) are report-only via
   `pnpm parity:api:calls:args:report`. New row? Pass what Rails passes;
   baselining is the fallback and costs a one-line `reason` on the baseline row.
   A single argument-shape deviation can instead carry a
   `@missingRailsArgs <ruby_call> — PERMANENT|CONVERGEABLE <story-id>` JSDoc tag
   at the call site — the call-ARGUMENT twin of
   `@missingRailsCall` — which suppresses the flag with no baseline row. Its
   tag must open with `PERMANENT` or `CONVERGEABLE`, the same permanence
   discipline `parity:api:extra` enforces on `@noRailsEquivalent`; a tag
   claiming neither is an error, not an assumed PERMANENT, and a bare
   `CONVERGEABLE` with no story id is only half a receipt.

3. **Did you touch a signature?** Parameter NAMES are gated too (RFC 0126) —
   `parity:api` prints a `params N/M` figure beside `arity`, `--params` lists
   every differing position, and

   ```bash
   pnpm parity:api:params   # the parameter-name ratchet
   ```

   fails on any increase over the committed per-package/per-file mark. arel is
   enrolled (at 0); other packages are measured and reported and join by their
   own story. A parameter keeps the Rails identifier, camelCased — so the fix is
   the rename, never the mark. Converged one? `pnpm parity:api:params:tighten`
   writes the mark DOWN; there is no reseed.

4. **Did you add any public TS name?** `pnpm parity:api:extra --package <pkg>` — it
   lists every public TS method, getter, class, and top-level function in a
   Rails-matched file with no Ruby counterpart. Anything you added and can't
   trace to a Ruby method is invented surface: delete it, fold it into the
   ported method, or tag it `@noRailsEquivalent <reason>`. Do **not** reach for
   a baseline allowlist to defer it. The tag is a receipt, not absolution — it
   says "known extra surface, not yet removed", and someone will come back for
   it.

   **`arel`, `activerecord` and `ruby-compat` are gated**, by the RFC 0117
   extra-surface ratchet:

   ```bash
   pnpm parity:api:extra:gate
   ```

   It reads the committed marks in `scripts/api-compare/extra-surface-mark.json`
   and is **only-shrink** for every gated package, like the two call gates: a
   new public name with no Ruby counterpart raises `novel` or `total` and turns
   it red, and the fix is to remove the name — never to raise the mark.
   **Converged something?** The mark then sits above the measurement; narrow it
   with `pnpm parity:api:extra:tighten`, which writes each dimension DOWN and
   never up. There is **no reseed**, for the same reason the call baselines
   forbid one.

   A package that has burnt its untagged novel surface to zero (`arel` today)
   is additionally **pinned**: its `novel` is the constant 0 regardless of what
   its row says, so widening the row cannot clear a red run. The only two
   remedies are a `@noRailsEquivalent PERMANENT|CONVERGEABLE <story-id>`
   receipt at the declaration, or deleting the name. That is where every gated
   package is headed — a receipt lives in the file you are already editing, so
   it never conflicts the way a shared counter does.

   Being pinned does **not** exempt `total`. A moved-not-novel extra is a name
   Rails does define, just in another `.rb`, and nothing else in the repo
   catches that: `rails-file-structure-method-order` orders members within one
   file and cannot see a cross-file relocation, and `parity:api:moves` only
   reports. So `total` stays gated in both modes.

   A package gets pinned as a reviewed step of its own burndown (the
   `activerecord-extra-surface-receipt-burndown` RFC for activerecord's 342,
   RFC 0129 for ruby-compat's 4). That direction is **only-grow**: no package
   is ever un-pinned to turn a red run green. Other packages are still measured
   and ungated; widening `GATED_PACKAGES` is a separate decision with its own
   burndown, not a mechanical step.

5. **Did you write an `@internal` tag?** `@internal` keeps its TypeDoc meaning —
   it holds a member out of the generated API reference — but it also drops the
   member from the measured surface entirely, so an `@internal` with nothing
   behind it hides extra surface for free. Two rules police the pair, both over
   `eslint/rails-private-methods.json` (built by `pnpm rails-privates:manifest`
   from `rails-api.json`, so both run in the `rails-comparison` CI job):
   - `blazetrails/rails-private-jsdoc` **requires** `@internal` where the Rails
     counterpart is private on every host in that Ruby file. Autofixable.
   - `blazetrails/unbacked-internal-needs-receipt` (RFC 0121) is the reverse: a
     public declaration carrying `@internal` whose (file, name) is absent from
     the manifest must ALSO carry a `@noRailsEquivalent PERMANENT|CONVERGEABLE`
     receipt, which wins in the extractor so the member re-enters the measured
     surface and is scored `Allowed` rather than vanishing. Not autofixable — the
     remedies are a receipt in one of the two shapes above, or deleting a tag
     that was never earned.
     (A real TS `private`/`protected`/`#` member still confers internal
     unconditionally; only the JSDoc tag yields.)

   The reverse rule ships behind a **per-package enrollment set** — its `files`
   list in `eslint.config.mjs` and `eslint/rails-private-jsdoc.config.mjs`, which
   must stay in sync. That set is **only-grow**: a package joins once its tags
   are burnt down (one story per package under RFC 0121), and no package is ever
   removed to turn a red run green.

6. **Working in `arel` or `activemodel`?** `pnpm lint --fix` after step 2 —
   `blazetrails/rails-file-structure-method-order` enforces Rails source order
   for class members and top-level functions and is autofixable, but it needs
   the manifest `pnpm parity:api` builds. Without a compare run it silently
   passes everything, then fails in the `Rails API/Test Comparison` CI job.
7. **`pnpm parity:api` / `pnpm parity:test`** deltas must be non-negative.

## Module mixins (Ruby `include` → TypeScript)

Rails uses `include`/`extend` to mix module methods into a class. TS has no
equivalent, so we use **`this`-typed functions assigned directly to the class**.

```ts
// attribute-methods.ts
export function aliasAttribute(this: AttributeMethodHost, newName: string, oldName: string): void {
  this._attributeAliases[newName] = oldName;
}

// model.ts
import { aliasAttribute } from "./attribute-methods.js";
export class Model {
  static aliasAttribute = aliasAttribute;
}
```

Why: code lives in the file that matches Rails' layout (so `parity:api`
finds it), no delegation wrappers, type-checked via the host interface,
and `this` resolves to the actual subclass at runtime.

For **instance methods mixed in bulk** (like Rails' `include QueryMethods`),
use `include()` / `Included<>` from `@blazetrails/activesupport`. See
`ruby-compat/src/include.ts` and `relation.ts` + `relation/query-methods.ts`.

When NOT to use this:

- A **string-named** `extended` / `included` / `inherited` method. Those names
  are Ruby lifecycle hooks; a TS method spelled that way is drift, not a
  mirror, which is why `SKIP_GROUPS` in `scripts/parity/conventions.ts` marks
  them `tsMirrorIsDrift: true` and `parity:api:extra` keeps flagging them.
- If the method needs Model-specific state beyond the host interface,
  keep it in `model.ts` directly.

`included` and `extended` themselves **do** have a TS equivalent, and the
sentence above is only about the spelling. `include()` / `extend()` fire
callbacks keyed by the exported `included` / `extended` symbols
(`Symbol.for("@blazetrails/ruby-compat:included")`, see
`ruby-compat/src/include.ts`), which is how you port an
`included do ... end` block. Because they are symbol-keyed they are not public
string-named members, so they never collide with the `SKIP_GROUPS` entry above.
Only `inherited` has no equivalent — JS has no hook that fires when a subclass
is defined, so its Rails semantics have to be deferred some other way.

The class-method half of a Concern is `extend()` / `Extended<>`, the mirror of
Ruby `extend SomeModule` — reach for it instead of hand-assigning
`static x = x` onto the class. And an `included do class_attribute :foo ... end`
is `classAttribute()` from `@blazetrails/activesupport`, which already gives
Rails' semantics (reads walk the constructor chain, writes are local to the
class); do not hand-roll copy-on-first-write per call site.

## Generated attribute readers are properties (`define_method_attribute`)

Ruby's `attr_reader`-shaped API is a zero-arg method, so `person.name` and
`person.name()` are the same call. TypeScript has no such equivalence: a
zero-arg Ruby reader **ports as an accessor property**, never as a method the
caller has to invoke. `person.name` is the whole surface a trails user sees,
and every consumer in the repo — serialization, dirty tracking, `toJSON`,
association writers — reads it that way.

That one decision has a fixed set of consequences, and they are ratified here,
repo-wide, so no port re-derives them at its own call site:

- **Every package that generates readers needs a `define_method_attribute`
  hook**, including ActiveModel — where Rails has none. Rails' bare
  `define_attribute_method_pattern`
  (`activemodel/lib/active_model/attribute_methods.rb:333-346`) falls through to
  `define_proxy_call`, which emits `def name; attribute("name"); end`; that
  shape cannot produce a property, so `respond_to?("define_method_attribute",
true)` must be true in trails wherever it is false in Ruby. Only ActiveRecord
  defines the hook upstream
  (`activerecord/lib/active_record/attribute_methods/read.rb:11`).
- **One descriptor carries both halves.** A `MethodSet` applies one descriptor
  per generated name (`code_generator.rb:32-36`) and a JS property cannot take
  its `get` from one and its `set` from another, so a generated reader property
  also carries the write half, and `define_method_attribute=`'s generated
  `name=` (`attributes.rb:92`) sits beside it rather than being its setter.
- **The reader and writer halves carry different types.** A Rails writer takes
  the raw value (`_write_attribute(name, value)`,
  `activerecord/attribute_methods/write.rb:36`) and the reader returns the cast
  one (`_read_attribute`, `read.rb:35`), so no single field type is honest. A
  generated member is emitted as a `get name(): CastType` /
  `set name(value: unknown)` pair — in an interface that merges with the model
  class, since a class body cannot hold a bodiless accessor. A hand-written
  `declare` may name the reader type alone wherever nothing writes a raw value
  to it.
- **A generated reader must not shadow an inherited method.** Rails may freely
  let a reader shadow `to_json`, because a Ruby reader is still an ordinary
  method; a generated `toJSON` _property_ hands `JSON.stringify` a string where
  the runtime demands a function. So reader generation skips a name a class
  body already answers — the JS spelling of Rails'
  `!superclass.instance_method(name).owner.is_a?(GeneratedAttributeMethods)`
  (`activerecord/attribute_methods.rb:170-176`), which ActiveRecord gets from
  its `instance_method_already_implemented?` override.

This is a genuine language shortcoming, not a preference. Code implementing any
of the three cites **this section** — `@noRailsEquivalent` there is a pointer to
a ratified repo-wide rule, not a local justification, and a new instance is not
a new decision to argue.

## Serialization's dual sync/async hash (`serializable_hash` / `as_json`)

Ruby's `serializable_add_includes`
(`activemodel/lib/active_model/serialization.rb:191`) reads an association
synchronously — `if records = send(association)` — and `CollectionProxy#to_ary`
lazily loads it in-line at `serialization.rb:143`. In trails an association read
is async, so an `include:`-bearing `serializable_hash` cannot be fully
synchronous.

**The settled answer is the dual-shape return** — `thenableHash` in
`activemodel/src/serialization.ts` builds a Proxy that is both a plain hash and
a `PromiseLike`. Read a key off it and you get the synchronous hash, where an
unloaded `include:` fails loud rather than silently serializing nothing;
`await` it and the includes are lazily loaded first, which is where Ruby's
in-line `to_ary` load lands. `asJsonThenable` is the same shape for
`ActiveModel::Serializers::JSON#as_json`
(`activemodel/lib/active_model/serializers/json.rb:96-110`), and
`serializableHash`'s third parameter is the module-private sync re-entry flag
the Proxy calls back through.

**The alternative — `serializableHash` / `asJson` returning `Promise`
unconditionally, the way RFC 0063 made `isValid()` return `Promise<boolean>` —
was considered and rejected, because an async `asJson` propagates through the
whole JSON encoder and takes `to_json` with it.** `asJson` is not one method;
it is the recursive dispatcher at
`activesupport/src/core-ext/object/json.ts:256`, standing in for Ruby's
`as_json` method lookup, and there are ~19 `asJson` definitions feeding it.
`Array.asJson` recurses per element back through that dispatcher (`:125-137`)
and `Enumerable.asJson` delegates to `Array.asJson` (`:85-89`), so any
collection containing a model goes async. `JSONGemEncoder#jsonify`
(`activesupport/src/json/encoding.ts:40`, Rails'
`activesupport/lib/active_support/json/encoding.rb`) recurses through `asJson`
for every nested node, so the encoder goes async; `Encoding#encode`
(`encoding.ts:19`) and its call sites follow, and **`to_json` returns a
Promise** where Rails' returns a String
(`activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/object/json.rb:35-43`). That is a
fidelity loss at a more prominent Rails surface than the thenable it would
remove. And it does not even buy the simplification: `jsonify` would still need
a synchronous path for the `JSON.stringify` case, so the same sync/async split
survives — relocated out of one contained Proxy and duplicated across every
`asJson` definition in the repo.

**The `JSON.stringify` → `toJSON` path is not the binding constraint.**
`JSON.stringify` does call `toJSON` synchronously and never awaits, and trails'
`toJSON` (`activesupport/src/core-ext/object/json.ts:47-60`, the port of
`ActiveSupport::ToJsonWithActiveSupportEncoder#to_json`) returns
`this.asJson()` from inside that synchronous call — but on that path `toJSON`
receives only the property key and calls `asJson()` with **no options**, so
there is no `include:` to load and nothing to await. It is a fixable coupling,
not a wall; do not mistake it for the decision's foundation. There is also no
third shape: `to_json` is Rails-facing API, so it cannot be dropped to buy the
uniform Promise.

This is a genuine language shortcoming — JS has no synchronous await and no
lazily-loading collection read — and it is ratified repo-wide here.
`thenableHash`, `asJsonThenable` and `preloadIncludes` carry
`@noRailsEquivalent PERMANENT` receipts against this section, and the
`SerializableHash` type and the `sync` re-entry parameter exist to serve them.
Do not re-derive the decision per call site, and do not file a story to make
them `Promise`.

## Call-time constant resolution (Ruby autoload → the zero-import slot)

Ruby resolves a constant named inside a method body when the method **runs**,
and Zeitwerk autoloads the file at that moment. So `contexts.rb:36` can name
`EncryptingOnlyEncryptor` and `config.rb` can name `DerivedSecretKeyProvider`
without either file taking a load-order dependency on them.

ESM has no equivalent. Every `import` is eager and evaluated before the
importing module's body, so naming a constant in a method body still costs a
module-eval edge. When that edge closes a cycle whose participants include a
`class Sub extends Super`, entering the graph at `super.ts` evaluates `Sub`
with `Super` still in TDZ and the module throws
`Cannot access 'Super' before initialization`.

**The settled answer is a zero-import slot module**: a file with no runtime
imports at all (so it cannot join any cycle) exporting a mutable binding plus a
`_setX()` setter, which the defining module calls at the bottom of its own
body. Readers import the binding from the slot and use it at call time, exactly
where Ruby resolves the constant. Nine instances exist and are the only ones:

- `activerecord/src/encryption/configurable-slot.ts` — `Configurable`, read by
  `encryptor.ts`, `context.ts`, `scheme.ts`, `key-provider.ts`,
  `key-generator.ts`.
- `activerecord/src/associations/collection-proxy-slot.ts` — the
  `CollectionProxy` ctor, read by `associations.ts`.
- `activerecord/src/associations/_scope-slots.ts` — the `AssociationRelation`
  factory and the `DisableJoinsAssociationScope` builder, read by
  `associations/association.ts` for `Association#scope`
  (`associations/association.rb:107-115,312-314`). The cycles are closed by
  `class AssociationRelation extends Relation` (`association-relation.ts`) and by
  `disable-joins-association-scope.ts`, so `association.ts` cannot import either
  back.
- `activemodel/src/attribute/user-provided-default-slot.ts` — the
  `UserProvidedDefault` ctor, read by `attribute.ts` for
  `Attribute#with_user_default` (`activemodel/lib/active_model/attribute/user_provided_default.rb:7-9`).
  The cycle is closed by `class UserProvidedDefault < FromUser`
  (`attribute/user-provided-default.ts`), so `attribute.ts` cannot import it
  back.
- `arel/src/node-slots.ts` — the `Not` / `Grouping` / `Or` / `And` / `Equality`
  / `In` / `Attribute` / `Dot` / `Table` ctors and `buildQuoted`, read by
  `nodes/node.ts`, `nodes/node-expression.ts`, `nodes/binary.ts`,
  `nodes/casted.ts`, `arel.ts`, `tree-manager.ts`.
- `rack-session/src/ruby-class-path-slot.ts` — the Ruby constant path a store
  registers for itself, read by `abstract/id.ts`'s `rubyClassPath` (Ruby's
  `self.class`, `rack-session/lib/rack/session/abstract/id.rb:155,396`). The
  cycle is closed by `class Pool extends PersistedSecure` (`pool.ts`), so
  `id.ts` cannot import `pool.ts` back.
- `trailties/src/trails-slot.ts` — the `Trails` constant, read by
  `engine/lazy-route-set.ts` for `Rails.application&.reload_routes_unless_loaded`
  (`engine/lazy_route_set.rb:12-104`). The cycle is closed by
  `class Application extends Engine` (`application.ts`), so `lazy-route-set.ts`
  cannot import `rails.ts` back.
- `actionview/src/base-slot.ts` — `Base`, read by `template/handlers/tse.ts` for
  `annotate_rendered_view_with_filenames` (`handlers/erb.rb:86-89`). The cycle
  is closed by `template.rb:178`'s `extend Template::Handlers`, whose port
  constructs the handler at `template.ts` class-static time.
- `activerecord/src/base-slot.ts` — `Base`, read by `dynamic-matchers.ts`,
  `connection-handling.ts` and `core.ts` for Rails' `self == Base`
  (`dynamic_matchers.rb:7`, `connection_handling.rb:318,324`, `core.rb:241`).
  The cycle is closed by `base.ts` importing all three, so none of them can
  import `base.ts` back.

This is a genuine language shortcoming, not a preference, and it is the one
sanctioned shape for it — do not re-derive a per-cluster justification, and do
not reach for a slot when a plain import does not actually close a cycle.
Verify both directions with a plain-node import of the **built** `dist/**.js`
modules as entry modules; a vitest run enters the funnel module first and masks
the TDZ, so a green suite proves nothing here.

Deferring the subclass edges instead (a slot per `extends` site) is the
alternative that looks smaller and does not work: nothing then loads the
subclass modules at all, so their self-registration never runs.

**A slot read carries no guard**, because the Ruby body it mirrors carries none:
`Arel::Nodes::Node#not` is `Nodes::Not.new self` (`arel/nodes/node.rb:122`) and
raises `NameError` if the constant will not resolve. So a reader is written
`new _Not!(this)`, and an unset slot surfaces as a plain `TypeError` at the call
site — the JS analogue of that `NameError`. A `throw` explaining that the caller
deep-imported the module is invented surface: it is a guard Rails does not have,
in a body that is otherwise line-for-line. This is the one place the decision is
recorded; do not re-derive it per slot or per call site.
