# Browser Compatibility Plan

This document codifies the portability policy for the trails monorepo so each
new package doesn't rediscover it. It also tracks the migration from the
current ad-hoc state to a fully enforced baseline.

## 1. Principles

**Native deps are never imported eagerly from any package barrel/index.**
`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:crypto`, `pg`, `mysql2`, `better-sqlite3` are
all server-only. Eagerly bundling them into a barrel causes tree-shakers to
leave them in browser builds even when the feature is unused. Lint rules and
browser-bundle CI (added in BC-4) enforce this.

**Database adapters opt in via registry, not eager import.**
Apps that use PostgreSQL import `@blazetrails/activerecord/adapters/postgresql`,
MySQL import `@blazetrails/activerecord/adapters/mysql2`, SQLite import
`@blazetrails/activerecord/adapters/sqlite3`. Core activerecord has zero top-level imports of
adapter packages. The goal is _PG-not-bundled-when-unused_, not
_PG-in-the-browser_.

**Env vars are accessed through `getEnv()` in activesupport.**
Direct `process.env` reads break in environments that lack `process`
(browsers, Deno, Bun edge runtimes). All env reads go through `getEnv(key,
defaultValue?)`, which falls back gracefully. The single canonical name for
the application environment is `TRAILS_ENV` — see §2 for the rationale.

**Each package owns a one-line portability status** (the matrix in §4).
New packages must declare their status before merging.

## 2. Existing plumbing

### activesupport adapter pattern

`packages/activesupport/src` already ships `fsAdapter`, `pathAdapter`,
`cryptoAdapter` (and others — see [activesupport.md](../activesupport.md) §Adapters).
Twenty files across activerecord use `getFs()` / `getPath()` / `getCrypto()`
instead of importing `node:*` directly, and there are zero bare `node:*`
imports in `packages/activerecord/src` (excluding `tsc-wrapper/`, a
build-time tool). This pattern is the template for every future native-dep
abstraction.

### The `CryptoAdapter` seam in a browser

A browser **is** a supported host for `@blazetrails/ruby-compat`'s crypto
seam, but only for hosts that register an adapter before the first synchronous
`getCrypto()` call. There is no browser auto-registration arm and there will
not be one: `tryAutoRegisterNode()` is Node-only by construction, and Web
Crypto cannot satisfy `CryptoAdapter`. `crypto.getRandomValues` /
`crypto.randomUUID` serve `randomBytes` / `randomUUID`, but `crypto.subtle`
has no synchronous digest (`HashAdapter#digest()` returns a value, not a
Promise) and no streaming `update()` / `final()` cipher, so `createHash`,
`createHmac`, `createCipheriv` and `createDecipheriv` have no Web Crypto
implementation. Auto-registering a randomness-only adapter would turn a clear
"not configured" error into a `createHash is not a function` deep inside
`digest.ts` / `message-encryptor.ts` / `security-utils.ts` /
`secure-password.ts`.

A randomness-only adapter is nonetheless **declarable**: register it with
`registerCryptoAdapter(name, adapter)` and select it with
`cryptoAdapterConfig.adapter = name`. The seam completes a partial adapter at
resolve time, so an unimplemented member raises a seam-level
`Crypto adapter "<name>" does not implement <member>.` naming what is missing,
rather than a `TypeError` at the call site. A host that only constructs an
`Instrumenter` (`SecureRandom.hex(10)`) or reads `SecureRandom` needs nothing
more than the randomness pair.

Call sites do **not** branch on the host. `Instrumenter#uniqueId` reaches the
seam unconditionally, exactly as its Ruby counterpart calls `SecureRandom`
unconditionally; per-call-site `try/catch` fallbacks onto
`crypto.getRandomValues` are not reinstated.

`Bytes` (`ruby-compat/src/fs-adapter.ts`) is already `Uint8Array`-based, so
`Buffer` is a Node-adapter implementation detail and not part of the seam's
type surface.

### `TRAILS_ENV` vs `NODE_ENV`

The JS ecosystem treats `NODE_ENV` as a _build-time hint_ (bundlers replace it
statically), not a reliable runtime value. BC-2 replaces all `NODE_ENV` reads
with `TRAILS_ENV` — no fallback, no shim. Pre-release means no backwards
compat obligations.

### SQLite driver registry

The SQLite driver track (shipped) established the registry pattern:
`DriverFactory` interface, `registerDriver()` call in the adapter
subpath export, capability flags so the adapter layer can branch on
async vs sync. Live in `@blazetrails/activerecord/sqlite-adapter`; see that
source file's JSDoc for the interface reference. The database-adapter
registry in BC-3 copies this shape verbatim.

## 3. Migration plan

### BC-1 — this document (~250 LOC, plan-only) ✅ #1250

Establishes vocabulary, cross-links existing plans, and sequences the work.
No code changes.

### BC-2 — `getEnv()` accessor + migrate 6 activerecord files (~80 LOC) ✅ #1251

Add `getEnv` to `packages/activesupport/src/environment.ts` with two
overloads:

```ts
function getEnv(key: string, defaultValue: string): string;
function getEnv(key: string): string | undefined;
```

Read-back policy: read `TRAILS_ENV` only — no `NODE_ENV` fallback.
Pre-release; direct replacement. The `defaultValue` argument (e.g.
`getEnv("TRAILS_ENV", "development")`) is for explicit caller-supplied
defaults, not for `NODE_ENV` aliasing.

Files to migrate:

| File                                 | Sites | Old name                                         | New name                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ----- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `token-for.ts:32`                    | 1     | `process.env` guard                              | `getEnv()` guard                                          |
| `connection-handling.ts`             | 3     | `process.env.NODE_ENV`                           | `getEnv("TRAILS_ENV", "development")`                     |
| `schema.ts:114`                      | 1     | `process.env.NODE_ENV`                           | `getEnv("TRAILS_ENV", "development")`                     |
| `database-configurations.ts:254,269` | 2     | `NODE_ENV`, `DATABASE_URL`                       | `TRAILS_ENV`; `DATABASE_URL` stays                        |
| `migration.ts:1461,1931`             | 2     | `NODE_ENV`, `DISABLE_DATABASE_ENVIRONMENT_CHECK` | `TRAILS_ENV`, `TRAILS_DISABLE_DATABASE_ENVIRONMENT_CHECK` |
| `tasks/database-tasks.ts:350,358`    | 2     | `VERSION`                                        | `VERSION` — reverted, see below                           |

`DATABASE_URL` is an industry standard and stays unchanged.

**`VERSION` is an exception, reverted in #6980.** BC-2 renamed it to
`TRAILS_MIGRATION_VERSION`, but `DatabaseTasks.target_version` /
`check_target_version` are a single-source pair over `ENV["VERSION"]`
(`database_tasks.rb:317-325`) that the `db:migrate:up` / `:down` rake tasks
read and require directly (`databases.rake:170`), and RFC 0051 converges that
pair on Rails' shape. The prefixed name lost to Rails fidelity here; `VERSION`
is the only key `targetVersion()` reads, and it is what `trails db migrate:up`
/ `:down` and `ar db:migrate --version` publish. This is a per-variable
exception, not a reversal of the `TRAILS_` policy — `TRAILS_ENV` and
`TRAILS_DISABLE_DATABASE_ENVIRONMENT_CHECK` are unaffected.

**Implementation note (shipped in #1251):** The original spec called for the full
`EnvAdapter` / `registerEnvAdapter` / `getEnvAdapter` pattern mirroring `getFs`.
BC-2 shipped the simpler shape — a thin `getEnv()` wrapper over
`globalThis.process.env` with no registry. The simpler shape is sufficient for
every use case through BC-4. If a future consumer needs to inject a different env
source (e.g. `import.meta.env` in a browser shim), lift `environment.ts` to the
full adapter pattern at that point.

### BC-3 — database-adapter registry — partial

Subpath exports shipped for `postgresql-adapter`, `mysql2-adapter`,
`sqlite3-adapter`. The eager `pg`/`mysql2` leaks from non-subpath-entry
files were closed in #1296 + #1549 (`temporal-type-parsers.ts`).
`peerDependenciesMeta` is in place.

**Still open:**

- **Self-registering adapter registry** (~100 LOC) — the
  `registerAdapter`/`adapterRegistry` "register at import time" pattern
  the original spec called for has not shipped. Today, importing
  `@blazetrails/activerecord/connection-adapters/postgresql-adapter.js`
  exposes the class but no global registry tracks "postgresql is wired."
  The "no adapter registered for X" error message from the spec doesn't
  exist.

### BC-3b — encryption namespace bundle-cleanliness — shipped #1302

Shipped in #1302 — encryption namespace moved behind subpath; `zlib` no
longer reachable from the activerecord barrel. Historical detail follows.

Original motivation: `packages/activerecord/src/encryption/config.ts:84`
did `import { deflateSync, inflateSync } from "zlib"` at module
top-level, reachable from the activerecord barrel via:

```
index.ts → encryption/install.js (installExtendedQueriesIfConfigured)
  → encryption.ts → encryption/configurable.ts → encryption/config.ts → "zlib"
```

So `import @blazetrails/activerecord` transitively pulls `node:zlib`, even for apps that don't use encryption. Same class of bundle-cleanliness issue as the pg/mysql2 leaks #1296 just closed; promoted to its own line so it doesn't drown in BC-5's iterative bucket.

**Approach: subpath import, mirror the pg/mysql2 pattern from BC-3.** Move the encryption namespace out of barrel reachability:

- Add `@blazetrails/activerecord/encryption` (and potentially nested subpaths if needed) to `package.json` exports.
- Remove encryption symbols from `packages/activerecord/src/index.ts` (the barrel).
- Anything currently re-exported from the barrel for ergonomics — `Encryption.configure(...)`, `installExtendedQueriesIfConfigured`, etc. — moves to subpath-only access. Consumers update from `import { configure } from "@blazetrails/activerecord"` to `import { configure } from "@blazetrails/activerecord/encryption"`.

The encryption subsystem is server-only by design (key management, compressor, key generators). Moving the whole namespace to a subpath:

- Solves the `zlib` leak by making encryption barrel-unreachable.
- Matches the BC-3 pattern used for pg/mysql2 adapters — consistency.
- Frees `installExtendedQueriesIfConfigured` from being barrel-reachable.
- Closes the issue permanently — future encryption-internal uses of `node:crypto` / `zlib` / etc. won't reopen the same conversation.

LOC: ~100-150 net (subpath export + barrel cleanup + caller-migration if any internal-test callsites use the barrel).

**Out of scope:** alternatives like `pako` for in-browser deflate (option D from triage) are unnecessary because encryption is server-only forever — bundle-cleanliness is the goal, not browser execution.

### BC-4 — lint rules + browser-bundle CI smoke test (~150 LOC) 🟡 partial

Three gates were planned. Two ESLint rules shipped; the third gate (browser bundle CI) and a stricter native-package rule are still pending.

1. ✅ **`no-node-builtins` ESLint rule** (`eslint/no-node-builtins.mjs`) — rejects direct imports of Node.js built-in modules (`fs`, `path`, `crypto`, `os`, etc.) in browser-compatible packages, with autofix that rewrites the import + all usage sites to the activesupport adapter (`getFs`, `getPath`, `getCrypto`).
2. ✅ **`no-process-bypass` ESLint rule** (`eslint/no-process-bypass.mjs`) — covers `process.X` access for properties routed through activesupport's processAdapter (`platform`, `exit`, `stdout`, `stderr`, etc.). Autofixable for safe replacements.
3. ❌ **`no-direct-process-env` rule for `process.env.X`** — NOT yet shipped. The existing `no-process-bypass` covers `process.platform` etc. but does not gate `process.env`. Live grep shows direct `process.env` usage still in `test-databases.ts`, `test-setup-worker-db.ts`, and adapter test-helpers. Some of those are legitimately test-only; the rule should allow-list `**/*.test.ts` and `**/test-*.ts` and gate the rest.
4. ❌ **`no-native-package-import` rule** — NOT yet shipped. `pg`, `mysql2`, `better-sqlite3` are still importable from non-adapter files. A rule rejecting these outside `**/adapters/{postgresql,mysql2,sqlite3}/**` and the named subpath-entry files would close the gap.
5. ❌ **Browser-bundle smoke test in CI** — NOT yet shipped. No `esbuild --platform=browser` step in `.github/workflows/*.yml`. Per-package job (or extension to existing `DX Type Tests` job) needed.

| Browser-bundle smoke            | `esbuild --bundle --platform=browser <barrel>` — fail on non-zero exit | ❌ planned in BC-4 |

A package barrel that resolves `node:fs` causes esbuild to exit non-zero,
failing the `Browser Bundle` job. Rely on esbuild's own exit code — don't
pipe to grep (grep exits 1 on no matches, which would fail CI when the build
is clean).

## 6. Open questions

- **Buffer / node: polyfills.** Do we offer a `Buffer` shim or similar on the
  browser side, or strictly require activesupport adapters? Current stance:
  strictly require adapters; polyfills hide leaks.

## Resolved (formerly open questions)

- **PG browser execution.** ✅ Resolved: PostgreSQL is server-only. No browser-compat support. The goal for `pg` is bundle-cleanliness so a browser barrel doesn't pull `pg` transitively, not browser execution. No `pg-driver-abstraction-plan.md` needed.
- **MySQL driver abstraction.** ✅ Resolved: MySQL is server-only. Same shape as PG — bundle-cleanliness only. No `mysql-driver-abstraction-plan.md` needed.

These resolutions simplify BC-3: pg/mysql2 just need to be excluded from browser bundles (lint rule + bundle smoke test in BC-4), not abstracted behind a registry. A registry would still be useful for adapter selection ergonomics, but isn't required for the BC track.
