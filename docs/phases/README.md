# Implementation Phases

Phases are numbered with sparse IDs (100, 200, ...) to allow insertion of
intermediate phases. Each phase should produce a usable, tested subset of
functionality.

## Current Coverage (as of 2026-03-06)

| ActiveRecord | 5428 | 742 | **13.7%** |
| **Overall** | **6791** | **2105** | **31%** |

## Notes on ActiveSupport Phases

Phases 1000–1400 introduce a new `@rails-ts/activesupport` package. Phase 1000
(Inflector) should ideally be done **early** — it eliminates duplicated
inflection code across `activemodel` and `activerecord` and is a prerequisite
for correct table name inference, association key generation, and model naming.

The remaining AS phases (1100–1400) can be done in parallel with the
ActiveRecord phases above, or deferred until the core AR functionality is solid.
