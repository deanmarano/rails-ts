/**
 * PR #5719 removed the global between-test reset (`cases/helper.ts` →
 * `resetTestAdapterState` → `resetTestTables`). That reset both DROPped every
 * non-canonical table and TRUNCATEd the boot-laid canonical ones, and the RFC
 * 0064 measurement that unblocked its removal instrumented only the DROP half —
 * so it proved no test leaked a *table*, and said nothing about leaked *rows*.
 *
 * The TRUNCATE half was load-bearing for test files that write rows without a
 * transactional wrap. #5719's first CI run found one on all three lanes:
 * `encryption/encryptable-record.test.ts`, where the `downcase: true` case's
 * book survived into the `ignore_case: true` case and `findBy({ name: "dune" })`
 * read the wrong row. The fix was to give that describe the Rails shape, since
 * Rails' own `ActiveRecord::TestCase` runs with `use_transactional_tests` on
 * (vendor/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/test_fixtures.rb:113, :146).
 *
 * What was left is an unenforced invariant: a test file that writes rows must
 * either ride `fixtures()` / `useTransactionalTests()` / `withTransactionalFixtures`,
 * or delete its own rows. This module checks it. A new non-transactional file
 * that writes rows is otherwise silently fine until some sibling case happens to
 * read the same table, and the resulting failure can be lane-specific (#5719's
 * second failure, in `abstract-mysql-adapter/warnings.test.ts`, only reproduced
 * on MariaDB) and so may not surface on the lane the author runs locally.
 *
 * The population is large and most of it is legitimate — files that clean up in
 * `afterEach`, or write to a table nothing else reads — so this is a ratchet
 * seeded from the tree, not a suite-reddening gate: the count may not grow.
 *
 * ## What the ratchet holds a file to
 *
 * A row only outlives its test if it was written over a connection some other
 * file also uses — the canonical per-worker connection. So the population is
 * files that (a) write rows at `it()` scope, (b) have no transactional wrap,
 * AND (c) reach that shared connection (`SHARED_CONNECTION_ACCESSORS`).
 *
 * Clause (c) is what retires the two classes the wrap-convergence pass could
 * not touch, because a wrap is not what they were missing:
 *
 * - **Throwaway per-test adapters** — the `adapters/*` cluster constructs its
 *   own adapter in `beforeEach` (`new BetterSQLite3Adapter(":memory:")`,
 *   `new PostgreSQLAdapter(PG_TEST_URL)` + per-test DDL) and closes it in
 *   `afterEach`. Rows cannot survive a database that is discarded, and a
 *   BEGIN/ROLLBACK around it would protect nothing.
 * - **Detector false positives** — `WRITE_PATTERNS` is deliberately textual and
 *   matches calls that write no row at all: `AliasTracker.create`,
 *   `SchemaDumper.create`, `Object.create`, `DatabaseTasks.create(config)`, a
 *   GCM cipher's `.update(...)`. None of those files touch the shared
 *   connection either.
 *
 * A model-level write (`Book.create(...)`) reaches the shared connection without
 * naming any accessor, so clause (c) also counts a write whose receiver is a
 * model class — a capitalised identifier that is not one of the
 * {@link NON_MODEL_RECEIVERS} the textual `WRITE_PATTERNS` also match. A file
 * that binds its models to an adapter it owns (`EnumTest.adapter = adapter`,
 * {@link EXPLICIT_ADAPTER_BINDING}) is writing over that adapter, not the shared
 * connection, which is what keeps the `adapters/*` cluster retired.
 *
 * The seed grew by one once `stripCommentsAndStrings` became a scanner. The
 * regex chain it replaced ran one pass per quote kind, so a quote of one kind
 * inside a literal of another paired with the next one anywhere in the file and
 * deleted everything between — the apostrophe in a template's `` `Couldn't find
 * a match` `` swallowed the rest of `encryption-schemes.test.ts`, taking its
 * unmatched parens with it and desynchronising the depth below. That file was
 * always an offender; it was hidden, not clean.
