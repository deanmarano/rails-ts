/**
 * Gate reference for the `changes` job's `- id: filter` step.
 *
 * The rationale for every `*_RE` in that step lives here rather than beside it:
 * the step is a single inline `run:` script under a hard GitHub Actions size
 * limit, crossing it fails the WHOLE workflow at startup — zero jobs, no checks
 * reported, no run created — and a comment costs exactly as many bytes as code.
 * This file already executes that gate block verbatim (see `gateRunner`), so it
 * is where the prose stays honest.
 *
 * Each entry is headed by the shell variable or line it documents.
 *
 *
 *  base/head fallback + INFRA_RE
 *  First push to a branch has a zero-SHA base; force-push may
 *  rewrite history out from under us. In either case we can't
 *  reliably compute a diff — fall back to running the full matrix.
 *  activerecord_affected gates the three AR test jobs (sqlite,
 *  postgres, mariadb). True when changes touch activerecord, its
 *  runtime deps (arel/activemodel/activesupport/globalid), or any
 *  cross-cutting file (lockfile, root tsconfig, vitest config,
 *  shared scripts, this workflow). Push to main / schedule /
 *  workflow_dispatch always force true. Pattern mirrors the
 *  AR-touching set in scripts/parity/pipeline/run.ts.
 *  Cross-cutting paths force every per-package gate true. Anything
 *  here affects all packages: workspace topology, root tooling
 *  config, shared scripts, this workflow, composite actions.
 *  The blanket `scripts/` below also sweeps up subtrees that are NOT
 *  cross-cutting; INFRA_CARVEOUT_RE strips them back out — keep the
 *  two in sync. Every carved subtree must still be named in the gate
 *  of whichever job runs its tests, or a change confined to it runs
 *  nothing; scripts/ci-suite-coverage.test.ts enforces that pairing.
 *
 *  AR_PKGS_RE
 *  AR workspace deps: arel/activemodel/activesupport/globalid/
 *  did-you-mean (per packages/activerecord/package.json). Also
 *  consumes @blazetrails/trails-tsc at runtime via the tsc-wrapper
 *  CLI + type-virtualization modules (see packages/activerecord/src/
 *  tsc-wrapper, schema-columns-dump.test.ts), so trails-tsc changes
 *  can fail AR vitest suites — include it in the gate.
 *  activerecord-cli E2E suites run in the three AR DB jobs (its tests
 *  exercise the CLI against real DBs), so cli source changes must also
 *  flip activerecord_affected.
 *
 *  DB_ADAPTER_RE
 *  db_adapter_affected gates nothing on its own: it is the opt-in that
 *  runs the PG/MariaDB suites while a PR is still a draft, so a false
 *  negative costs a later signal, never coverage. `abstract/` and
 *  sql-classification.ts are in scope because that substrate breaks
 *  one backend without naming it (the latter carries the PG cursor
 *  statements in its read-only allowlist).
 *
 *  AP_PKGS_RE
 *  actionpack_affected gates actionpack-tests. True for actionpack +
 *  its runtime deps (actionview/activemodel/activesupport/rack/did-you-mean).
 *
 *  AV_PKGS_RE
 *  actionview_affected gates the actionview step of leaf-tests.
 *  ActionView's only
 *  workspace dependency is activesupport (see actionview/package.json).
 *
 *  TRAILTIES_PKGS_RE
 *  trailties_affected gates trailties-tests. Trailties consumes
 *  actionpack/actionview/activerecord/rack/activesupport, so any of
 *  their workspace upstreams also flips this on.
 *
 *  TRAILS_TSC_PKGS_RE
 *  trails_tsc_affected gates the virtualized DX type tests, the
 *  blocking trails-tsc-tests job, and trails-tsc-coverage.
 *  Workspace consumers of @blazetrails/trails-tsc today: activerecord
 *  (tsc-wrapper + type-virtualization) and scripts/guides-typecheck;
 *  AR consumption is the reason trails-tsc is also in AR_PKGS_RE.
 *
 *  AUDIT: virtualized-dx-type-tests / trailties-tests / leaf-tests
 *  (RFC 0028, audit-virtualized-dx-and-leaf-gates-against-real-inputs)
 *  All three gate on plain `activerecord_affected` and so run on every
 *  AR PR. The audit asked whether their real source closure is narrower
 *  than the gate. It is not, for any of them — the gates stay as they
 *  are. What each suite actually reads:
 *
 *  - virtualized-dx-type-tests runs `pnpm test:types:virtualized`
 *    (package.json:20), which is `tsc -b packages/activerecord-cli`
 *    followed by the tsc-wrapper CLI over
 *    packages/activerecord/virtualized-dx-tests/tsconfig.json. That
 *    tsconfig maps @blazetrails/activerecord to
 *    packages/activerecord/src/index.ts — the WHOLE public type surface,
 *    not the type-virtualization or tsc-wrapper subtrees — plus
 *    activemodel, arel, activesupport, i18n, date and globalid src. So
 *    the tempting narrowing (the story's own hypothesis: trails-tsc plus
 *    AR's type-virtualization/tsc-wrapper subtrees) would drop coverage
 *    of every AR type change the suite exists to catch.
 *    It has the opposite defect instead: @blazetrails/i18n is in the
 *    tsconfig's paths but in neither AR_PKGS_RE nor TRAILS_TSC_PKGS_RE,
 *    so an i18n-only PR type-checks against it without running it.
 *    Filed as a separate story rather than fixed here — closing it
 *    widens the gate, which is a burn decision, not an audit finding.
 *
 *  - trailties-tests runs `pnpm vitest run packages/trailties`.
 *    @blazetrails/activerecord is a runtime dependency
 *    (trailties/package.json) imported by src/database.ts,
 *    src/migration-loader.ts, src/schema-source.ts, src/commands/db.ts
 *    and the generators — all of which have their own .test.ts. The AR
 *    clause in TRAILTIES_PKGS_RE is load-bearing.
 *
 *  - leaf-tests' job-level `if` is exactly the union of its five
 *    per-step `if`s, and AR appears there only through the "DX type
 *    tests" step (`pnpm test:types`, whose vitest.dx-tests.config.ts
 *    declares activerecord and trailties projects). Narrowing the job
 *    gate below that union would skip a step that should have run; the
 *    per-step gates already keep the unaffected leaves from executing,
 *    so the measured burn is install cost, not suite cost.
 *
 *  TSE_COMPILER_PKGS_RE
 *  tse_compiler_affected gates the tse-compiler step of leaf-tests.
 *  The package has
 *  no workspace dependencies today (no activesupport import), so
 *  the gate matches the package path only.
 *
 *  RACK_PKGS_RE
 *  rack_affected gates the rack step of leaf-tests (split out of
 *  unit-tests so a rack-only PR doesn't drag in
 *  arel/activemodel/activesupport tests). Rack's only workspace
 *  dependency is activesupport. `rack-session` rides the same flag
 *  rather than getting its own: it is a leaf of the same size that
 *  depends on rack, so a rack-session change correctly runs the rack
 *  suite too, and one shared step keeps the billed-minute win the
 *  consolidated leaf job exists for. Note the alternation is spelled
 *  out — `^packages/(rack|...)/ ` does NOT match `packages/rack-session/`,
 *  because after `rack` it demands a `/`.
 *
 *  UNIT_TESTS_PKGS_RE
 *  unit_tests_affected gates the bundled vitest run for the small
 *  leaf packages (arel/activemodel/activesupport/i18n) and the
 *  scripts/guides-typecheck self-test. Rack is excluded here — it
 *  runs in the leaf-tests job.
 *  scripts/tasks/ and scripts/guides-typecheck/ also ride on this gate
 *  since they're bundled into the same vitest invocation as the leaf
 *  packages (ci.yml:604) — and both are carved out of the infra sweep
 *  (INFRA_CARVEOUT_RE), so this clause is what keeps their self-tests
 *  running on a subtree-only change.
 *  scripts/parity/pipeline/ rides on it too: the query-runner integration tests
 *  spawn dump.ts/ar_dump.ts against the fixtures, so a change to either
 *  the runners or the fixtures has to re-run them. (Their other input,
 *  packages/activerecord/, is deliberately NOT on this gate — pulling
 *  every AR PR into the leaf-package suites costs more than it catches;
 *  the label-gated query-parity-trails job covers that direction.)
 *  NO packages/activerecord/ path feeds this gate. The two suites here
 *  that import AR — scripts/test-deps/ and scripts/parity/pipeline/query/node/ —
 *  are re-run by sqlite-tests (activerecord_affected) instead; see the
 *  comment there.
 *  The compare tooling's suites run in that same invocation and are
 *  ALL in INFRA_CARVEOUT_RE, so without naming them here a change
 *  confined to one of them would run none of its own tests.
 *  schema-compare/ is deliberately absent — its suite parses the real
 *  vendored schema.rb, so it runs in rails-comparison (COMPARISON_RE).
 *  eslint/ rides on it because the custom rules' own RuleTester suites
 *  are in the same invocation: without this clause a PR that only
 *  touches a rule or its test would skip the only job that runs them.
 *  eslint.config.mjs is named separately (it is not under eslint/):
 *  eslint/rails-private-jsdoc.config.test.mjs is a drift guard between
 *  it and eslint/rails-private-jsdoc.config.mjs, so an isolated change
 *  to the root config must still run the guard.
 *  scripts/ci/check-control-bytes.sh is named for the same reason:
 *  eslint/no-raw-control-bytes.drift.test.mjs is a drift guard between
 *  its byte set and the ESLint rule's, and scripts/ci/ is carved out
 *  of the infra sweep (INFRA_CARVEOUT_RE).
 *
 *  GUIDES_PKGS_RE
 *  guides_affected gates the Guides Code Type Check job, which
 *  compiles fenced TS blocks in packages/website/docs/guides/**.
 *  Today guides only import @blazetrails/activerecord,
 *  @blazetrails/activemodel, and @blazetrails/activesupport — plus
 *  AR's transitive type deps. Confirmed via:
 *  grep -rhE "from ['\"]@blazetrails/[a-z-]+" packages/website/docs/guides
 *  scripts/guides-typecheck/ is the job's own implementation and is
 *  carved out of the infra sweep (INFRA_CARVEOUT_RE), so it must be
 *  named here or a checker-only change would stop running the checker.
 *
 *  WEBSITE_PKGS_RE
 *  website_affected gates the Website build (SvelteKit + typedoc +
 *  VitePress). Scoped narrowly to packages/website/ — package-source
 *  changes alone don't trigger it. To run the site build on a PR
 *  that touches package sources, apply the `website` label (or the
 *  `release` label, which always runs it). The job is also
 *  exercised post-merge by push-to-main.
 *
 *  COMPARISON_RE
 *  comparison_affected gates the Rails API/Test Comparison job. That
 *  job is only meaningful when Rails-port package source, the compare
 *  tooling (scripts/{api,test,fixtures,schema}-compare/ and the Rails
 *  manifest builders), or the vendored
 *  upstream Ruby sources changed — plus cross-cutting infra (INFRA_RE)
 *  below. A scripts/tasks-only, website-only, or other tooling-only
 *  change can't move any comparison output, so it skips.
 *  packages/website/ is EXCLUDED: it's the SvelteKit docs site, never
 *  one of apiComparePackages() (vendor/sources.ts), so the comparison
 *  never scans it — set_gate's exclusion argument drops it before
 *  the COMPARISON_RE `^packages/` clause is applied.
 *  NOTE: scripts/parity/conventions.ts regenerates
 *  docs/ruby-ts-conventions.md (checked by parity:api:conventions --check in
 *  the job); the scripts/api-compare/ clause keeps that drift check
 *  gated on. As with the package gates, infra_files (which carves out
 *  the single-consumer scripts/ subtrees) feeds the INFRA_RE half of
 *  the OR.
 *  docs/ruby-ts-conventions.md is ALSO matched directly: it's the
 *  generated artifact the conventions check guards, and the docs_only
 *  logic above (`:234`) deliberately keeps a hand-edit of it
 *  non-docs-only so the drift check still runs. Mirror that here — a
 *  PR that edits ONLY that file matches neither INFRA_RE nor the
 *  package/vendor clauses, so without this it would skip the very
 *  check the docs_only exception was built to preserve.
 *  eslint/rails-deprecated-methods.json is matched directly for the
 *  same reason as ruby-ts-conventions.md: it is the generated artifact
 *  the `--check-deprecated` step guards, and `eslint/` appears in
 *  neither INFRA_RE nor the package/vendor clauses. Without this, the
 *  one change shape the guard exists to catch — a commit that ONLY
 *  drops manifest entries — would skip rails-comparison entirely and
 *  never run the recompute.
 *  schema-compare/ (the Schema comparison step, ci.yml:1272) and the
 *  two Rails manifest builders + their shared mixin resolver (the
 *  privates/file-structure steps, ci.yml:1279/1293) are named
 *  explicitly: all are carved out of the infra sweep
 *  (INFRA_CARVEOUT_RE), so this clause is the only thing that still
 *  runs rails-comparison on a change confined to them.
 *
 *  elif ! files
 *  Triple-dot: diff against the merge-base of $base and $head, not
 *  against the current tip of the base branch. Using `$base $head`
 *  would also include every commit merged to main since this branch
 *  diverged, inflating the changed-files list with unrelated paths
 *  and triggering gates that shouldn't fire.
 *
 *  if echo "$files" | grep -qE '^(\.prettierrc\.json|\.prettierignore|package\.json)$'; then
 *  Prettier file list for the Prettier job. A change to Prettier's
 *  config or its version pin reformats the whole tree, so fall back
 *  to `__ALL__` (check everything) in that case — there is no other
 *  full-tree check to catch the resulting drift. Otherwise emit the
 *  changed files, excluding deletions (--diff-filter=ACMR keeps
 *  added/copied/modified/renamed) since Prettier can't format a path
 *  that no longer exists. If that diff somehow fails, fall back to
 *  `__ALL__` rather than silently skipping the check.
 *
 *  if [ -z "$files" ]; then
 *  docs_only: any line NOT under `docs/`, `examples/`, and not the
 *  top-level `README.md` flips the switch. README is markdown-only
 *  and only ever runs through prettier; `examples/` are standalone
 *  apps not built, type-checked, or tested by any CI job (the root
 *  `tsc --build` doesn't reference them and they have no `test`
 *  script) — so neither needs the full matrix.
 *
 *  Exception: docs/ruby-ts-conventions.md is GENERATED from
 *  conventions.ts and guarded by `parity:api:conventions --check` in the
 *  rails-comparison job. Treat a change to it as non-docs-only so a
 *  hand-edit (ignoring the file's do-not-edit banner) still runs the
 *  drift check instead of short-circuiting to a green docs-only run.
 *
 *  case "${{ github.event_name }}" in
 *  On push to main / schedule / workflow_dispatch force every
 *  package gate true. Downstream jobs still honor docs_only, so a
 *  docs-only push to main still short-circuits the matrix.
 *
 *  ADDITIVE_CANDIDATE_RE / is_additive_registration
 *  Registering a workspace package is ADDITIVE by construction: a new
 *  `packages/<pkg>` reference appended to tsconfig.json, a new alias in a
 *  vitest config, and the lockfile entries for a package nothing imports
 *  yet. That necessarily edits three paths INFRA_RE matches, yet reaches
 *  no existing package's build or test — #7319 and #7322 each ran the
 *  whole AR adapter matrix for a diff that could not affect it. A REAL
 *  config change to those SAME paths — an edited compilerOptions, a
 *  retargeted alias, a bumped shared dependency — does reach everything,
 *  which is exactly what INFRA_RE is for. So the discriminator cannot be
 *  the path: a path-only narrowing that let a real tsconfig.json edit
 *  through would be strictly worse than over-firing. It is the SHAPE of
 *  the hunk. A removed line is never additive (a registration only
 *  appends), and for tsconfig/vitest every ADDED line has to be a
 *  registration entry rather than a setting. pnpm-lock.yaml has no
 *  comparable shape to match on, so its rule is the removal rule alone:
 *  entries only ever added cannot change how an existing package
 *  resolves. Matching files are dropped from infra_files ONLY; they stay
 *  in $files, so any gate whose own regex names them still fires.
 *
 *  infra_files
 *  Drop the single-consumer scripts/ subtrees (see
 *  INFRA_CARVEOUT_RE above) from the infra sweep so a change
 *  confined to them doesn't trip INFRA_RE's blanket `scripts/`
 *  and force every package gate true (the whole Rails matrix).
 *  Per-package gates below still see the full $files list, so
 *  each carved subtree still flips its own consuming job's gate
 *  via that gate's regex.
 *
 *  case "${{ github.event_name }}" in
 *  Website label opt-in. The Website job otherwise gates only on
 *  packages/website/ paths, so PRs that need a site preview (or
 *  release PRs that must build the production site) can apply the
 *  `website` or `release` label to force the job on.
 *
 *  case "${{ github.event_name }}" in
 *  Per-adapter parity gates. Each suite is expensive (~15-20 CI
 *  minutes across 7 jobs), so plain PRs skip all parity. Run on:
 *  - push to main / schedule / workflow_dispatch → all adapters
 *  - PRs carrying a per-adapter label → only that adapter
 *  `any(.[]; ...)` guards against the `.[].name == "..."` bug where
 *  jq -e bases exit status on the last element of a stream.
