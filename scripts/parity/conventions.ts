  // predicate already port under the names the rules above produce unaided:
  // `HashWithIndifferentAccess#key?`/`has_key?`/`member?`
  // (hash_with_indifferent_access.rb:150-156) is `key()`/`hasKey()`/`member()`,
  // and `Parameters#has_key?`/`key?` (strong_parameters.rb:253-254) likewise.
  // `has` remains a CALL alias in `JS_ENUMERABLE_ALIASES`, where the file's
  // symbol set is not at stake.

These are the exact rules \`parity:api\` uses to match a Ruby method or file to
its trails TypeScript counterpart. Follow them when porting Rails code so the
comparison credits your implementation.

## Method names

The Example column shows the TS **symbol name(s)** parity:api looks for (it
matches the first candidate present in the target file), not a call expression.

| Ruby | TypeScript | Example |
| ---- | ---------- | ------- |
| \`predicate?\` (bare) | \`is*\` prefix, camel then \`Q\` fallback | \`valid?\` → ${example("valid?")} |
| \`is_*?\` | camel form (no doubled \`isIs*\`), \`Q\` fallback | \`is_number?\` → ${example("is_number?")} |
| ${predicatePrefixes} | camel form + \`is*\` / \`Q\` fallback | \`has_attribute?\` → ${example("has_attribute?")} |
| ${containmentPredicates} | \`is*\` / camel / native JS spelling / \`Q\` | \`include?\` → ${example("include?")} |
| \`name!\` (bang) | \`*Bang\` suffix | \`save!\` → ${example("save!")} |
| \`name=\` (setter) | bare camel name, \`set*\` fallback | \`table_name=\` → ${example("table_name=")} |
| \`initialize\` / \`new\` | \`constructor\` | \`initialize\` → ${example("initialize")} |
| \`to_s\` / \`to_str\` | \`toString\` | \`to_s\` → ${example("to_s")} |
| \`to_json\` | \`toJSON\` | \`to_json\` → ${example("to_json")} |
| \`to_sql\` | \`toSql\` | \`to_sql\` → ${example("to_sql")} |
| \`-@\` (unary minus) | \`negate\` | \`-@\` → ${example("-@")} |
| everything else | \`snake_case\` → \`camelCase\` | \`has_many\` → ${example("has_many")} |

Constructor details: \`new\` maps to \`constructor\` only when its Ruby file does
NOT also define \`initialize\`. A same-file \`new\` beside \`initialize\`
(\`ActionController::Renderer.new\`, \`renderer.rb:72\`, next to \`#initialize\`
at \`:111\`) is an ordinary singleton method that WRAPS the constructor, so it
is a second Ruby member, not a second spelling of the same one.

Predicate-form details: a predicate whose Ruby file ALSO defines the bare name
(\`Logger#debug\` next to \`Logger#debug?\`) offers the QUOTED LITERAL spelling
first — \`get "debug?"\` — because its camel candidate names the sibling, not the
predicate. Every predicate also offers the \`Q\` suffix as its LAST candidate
(\`active_connections?\` → \`activeConnectionsQ\`): \`Q\` is the query-method
letter, and it is the spelling trails uses wherever the bare camel name is
already taken on the same TS object by an unrelated Rails member
(\`connection_class\` next to \`connection_class?\`) — cases where \`is*\` reads
wrong and the quoted literal is unreachable by dot notation, as a \`static\` or
as a named \`export\`. It is offered last, so it only widens what counts and
never moves an existing pairing. \`is_*?\` collapses to a single camel candidate so trails can't
land the redundant doubled \`isIsNumber\`. Already-predicate prefixes keep the
\`is*\` fallback because the disambiguating alias is sometimes needed when the bare
name collides with a macro (e.g. \`isHasOne()\` alongside the \`Model.hasOne\`
declaration). Leading underscores and runs of underscores collapse like a single
underscore (\`visit__regexp\` → \`visitRegexp\`), and underscore-before-capital
collapses too (\`visit_Arel_Nodes_X\` → \`visitArelNodesX\`).

Private-helper details: every candidate above additionally offers its
\`_\`-prefixed spelling as a LAST candidate (\`convert_value_to_parameters\` →
\`_convertValueToParameters\`). trails prefixes a private helper with \`_\` to keep
it off the public surface — the convention \`eslint/rails-private-methods.json\`
is generated from — so a Ruby private method legitimately ports underscored.
Being last, it never moves an existing pairing. The fixed JS spellings
(\`constructor\`, \`toString\`, \`toJSON\`, \`toSql\`, \`negate\`) are excluded: those
are language-mandated names, not helper names.

Setter-form details: a Ruby \`name=\` writer matches the bare camel accessor
first, and \`set#{Name}\` second. The \`set*\` fallback covers writers whose Rails
body blocks on I/O — \`has_one\`'s \`#{name}=\` removes and persists the displaced
target inline — which a synchronous JS property setter cannot express. There the
promise-returning \`setAccount\` **is** the port of \`account=\`. Both spellings are
supported and both score as the port — the candidate list is a fallback chain, not
a migration: a sync accessor alone still matches, as it always did.
Underscore-prefixed
writers (\`_reflections=\`) are \`class_attribute\` storage slots, never blocking
writers, so they get no \`set*\` candidate. The ordering flips when the Ruby
surface defines the matching *reader* too (\`beginning_of_week\` alongside
\`beginning_of_week=\`): the reader has claimed the bare camel name, so the writer
is offered \`set#{Name}\` first — unless Ruby also defines \`set_#{base}\`, whose
own port already owns that spelling.

Name-collision details: a Ruby method whose name is also a JS **property**
keeps its Rails name and stays a method — \`CollectionProxy#length\`
(\`activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/collection_proxy.rb:786-795\`) is
\`length()\`, not a \`length\` getter, because loading the target is asynchronous
in trails and a property cannot await. Ruby has no property/method ambiguity,
so \`person.pets.length\` counts there while \`collection.length\` here reads the
METHOD. The delegated \`length\` therefore refuses primitive coercion
(\`relation/delegation.ts\`): \`collection.length > 0\` and
\`\${collection.length}\` throw rather than silently reading \`NaN\` or the
function source. Write \`await collection.length()\`, or
\`await collection.size()\` for Rails' \`size\`.

## Operators

These Ruby operator methods have no parity:api counterpart (map them to named
methods like \`get()\`/\`set()\` as the surrounding code does):

${operatorList}

The named spelling a given class picked is pinned per Ruby fqn in
\`OPERATOR_SPELLING_BY_FQN\` (\`scripts/api-compare/operator-order-spelling.ts\`) —
\`Arel::Math#*\` is \`multiply\`, \`Arel::Table#[]\` is \`get\`. Both the method-ORDER
manifest and \`parity:api:extra\` resolve operators through that table, so a
ported operator sorts into its Rails slot and does not read as extra surface.
The pin is per-class on purpose: \`<<\` is \`bitwiseShiftLeft\` on \`Arel::Math\` and
means _append_ on the collectors, so a global entry would mis-credit them.

## Token renames

Applied to every identifier before camelization (and the equivalent applies to
file paths). A token is renamed when it starts the identifier or follows an
underscore, and ends at an underscore, the end, or the next capital — so
\`ERBUtilTest\` is \`TSEUtilTest\` and \`erb_util\` is \`tseUtil\`, while
\`verb_name\` and \`Herbert\` are left alone. There is no \`erb\` anywhere in
trails:

| Ruby token | trails token |
| ---------- | ------------ |
${renameRows}

Test names are not an exception. Rails'
\`test "ERB::Util.html_escape should escape unsafe characters"\`
(\`activesupport/test/core_ext/string_ext_test.rb:1086\`) is
\`it("TSE::Util.html_escape should escape unsafe characters")\` in
\`core-ext/string-ext.test.ts\`. It still credits: \`normalizeErb\` in
\`scripts/test-compare/compare.ts\` applies this table to both sides of the
comparison, so the Ruby name and the TSE-spelled trails name normalize to the
same key. \`ERB\` survives in trails only where the text quotes the Ruby side —
a JSDoc \`Mirrors:\` line naming \`ERB::Util\`, a Rails path like
\`core_ext/erb/util.rb\`, or fixtures-compare's statuses for Rails YAML that
genuinely is ERB.

## File paths

Ruby \`foo_bar.rb\` → \`foo-bar.ts\` (kebab-case), with these path-segment aliases
applied first (trails railties are not \`Rails::Railtie\` subclasses):

| Ruby segment | trails segment |
| ------------ | -------------- |
${pathAliasRows}

Rails nests each command one directory deep and suffixes the file; trails
flattens both segments onto one file, so
\`commands/<dir>/<dir>_command.rb\` → \`commands/<dir kebab-cased>.ts\`
(\`commands/unused_routes/unused_routes_command.rb\` →
\`commands/unused-routes.ts\`). The directory and the file's stem must agree;
anything else takes the plain kebab-case rule.

## Skipped methods

parity:api never expects a TS counterpart for these Ruby methods:

${skipSections}

## Scoped skipped methods

parity:api skips these Ruby methods, but only within the listed files — they
have a real TS surface elsewhere, so the skip is file-scoped to avoid silencing
a genuine gap:

${scopedSkipSections}

## Ruby-only classes

parity:api expects no TS counterpart for these Ruby classes at all — neither
their methods nor their place in the inheritance chain. Each one only papers
over a gap in the Ruby standard library that JavaScript does not have:

${rubyOnlyClassSections}

## Arity overrides

The advisory arity check (arity.ts) suppresses these Ruby methods — their
positional-arg ranges diverge from the TS port for a documented reason (a Ruby
alias/delegate the extractor reads as zero-arg, a porting-pattern artifact),
not a real signature gap:

${arityOverrideSections}
`;
}
