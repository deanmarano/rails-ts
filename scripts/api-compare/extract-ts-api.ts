/**
 * Extracts the public API surface from our TypeScript packages.
 * Uses the TypeScript Compiler API.
 * Outputs output/ts-api.json
 *
 * ## Adding a per-method field derived from a declaration
 *
 * A `MethodInfo` is constructed in ~10 places here. Whether a
 * declaration-derived field (`internal`, `noRailsEquivalent`, …) must be
 * copied at a given site is decided by ONE thing: whether
 * `collectTsFileNames` (extra-surface.ts) counts that entry as the file's own
 * surface. That function is the authority — read it, don't reason by analogy.
 *
 * - counted → the site MUST read the declaration's metadata.
 * - not counted → it MUST NOT: the copied value can never match this file's
 *   Rails surface, so it reads as stale on top of the correct match on the
 *   declaring file. Only two populations are uncounted: `__mixin` members
 *   carrying `declaredIn` (skipped via `synthesizedMixin`) and
 *   `extractFileLocalHelpers` output (always `internal: true`).
 *
 * Interface `extends`-resolved members are the trap: they carry no
 * `declaredIn`, so they ARE counted — the `__mixin` analogy gets it backwards.
 *
 * The full inventory is pinned by "MethodInfo emit-site inventory" in
 * extract-ts-api.test.ts; extend that fixture when you add a field.

 * Reason prose of a FILE-level `@noRailsEquivalent` tag, or undefined when the
 * file carries none.
 *
 * The declaration-level tag answers "this NAME has no Rails counterpart". Some
 * whole files are in that position — `better-sqlite3-adapter.ts` exists because
 * the JS ecosystem has several interchangeable SQLite clients where Ruby binds
 * one gem — and writing the same reason on every declaration in them is pure
 * repetition (RFC 0072). The file-level form states it once.
 *
 * Two placements carry it, and both are ones TypeScript does NOT bind to a
 * declaration:
 *
 *   - a block above the IMPORTS, which TypeScript binds to that first import; and
 *   - a DETACHED block — one separated from whatever follows it by a blank line
 *     — which TypeScript binds to nothing at all.
 *
 * The invariant both preserve is the same: a block written directly ABOVE a
 * declaration is that declaration's own doc block (`noRailsEquivalentReason`
 * already reads it there), and reading it as file-level too would silently
 * widen every such tag into a blanket. The blank line is what separates the two
 * cases, which is why an import-less file could not carry the tag at all before
 * RFC 0121 — `temporal-tag.ts` and `ruby-truthy.ts` have no runtime imports by
 * design and nothing to hang it on.
 *
 * Both placements reach the SAME parse as the declaration-level tag, and so
 * inherit both of its hard errors: an empty reason, and a reason truncated by a
 * bare `@word` in its prose. A claim that could be silently cut short would not
 * be a checked one. The detached path gets there by re-parsing the file text up
 * to the end of the block with a synthetic declaration appended, so the tag is
 * read off a real node — the file name and line numbers in either error still
 * point at the real source.

/**
 * Credit a mixin object-literal PROPERTY by its key.
 *
 * The `include(Host, Mod)` mixin shape (CLAUDE.md, _Module mixins_) lists the
 * ported bodies in an exported object literal, and the file-function walker
 * harvests `function` DECLARATIONS — so a member whose Rails name can only be
 * spelled as a property key scores declaration-only even though its body ships:
 *
 * - `with: withCte` (relation/query-methods.ts) — `def with(*args)`
 *   (query_methods.rb:493). `function with()` is not writable: `with` is a
 *   reserved word in strict mode, and every module is strict.
 * - `excluding,` / `without,` — `def excluding(*records)` with
 *   `alias without excluding` (query_methods.rb:1574). trails ports the shared
 *   Ruby body once as `excludingWithCallee(callee)` and binds both names from
 *   it, which is why neither name is a `function` declaration.
 *
 * Narrow by construction, the same way the other credit arms are: the property
 * value must be an identifier resolving IN THIS FILE to something the checker
 * says is callable. An imported binding, a non-function const, or any other
 * expression credits nothing, and the caller drops a key the file-function
 * walker already credited so nothing can be counted twice.

 * Arms are counted per CLAUSE, matching extract-ruby-api.rb#walk_for_skeleton

 * CaseClauses emits one arm, so the `switch` port and the `if`/`else if` port

 * DefaultClause emits nothing, as Ruby's `else` does. A CatchClause's typed
 * arms are Ruby's `rescue` clauses, so each top-level `instanceof` arm tokens
 * as `rescue` IN PLACE OF the `if` its lowering spells, before that arm's own
 * reaches — where the Ruby `:rescue` clause node sits. A catch with no
 * `instanceof` chain is a bare Ruby `rescue` and emits exactly one.
