/**
 * Extractor output-schema token for the ts-api cache key.
 *
 * The per-package ts-api cache (`output/ts-api-cache/<pkg>.json` plus the
 * cross-worktree shared store) keys partly on this token. When it changes,
 * every stale entry whose shape predates the change is evicted — without it, an
 * entry cached BEFORE a new per-method field was added is served verbatim
 * WITHOUT the field. That was the PR #4020 trap: `calls` (the call-set
 * dimension) was added to the extractor in PR #4002 but the cache token was not
 * bumped, so a fresh local `pnpm parity:api` served call-less manifests for
 * every package whose source hadn't changed and the call-mismatch gate reported
 * the inverse of reality. Only `API_COMPARE_FORCE=1` recovered fidelity.
 *
 * Two independent inputs make the token self-busting, so adding a field can't
 * silently leave stale entries even if a human forgets a manual bump:
 *
 *   1. {@link EXTRACTOR_OUTPUT_FIELDS} — the declared per-method field set, the
 *      INTENTIONAL token a reviewer can audit. Add a field name here whenever
 *      you add a `MethodInfo` property the extractor populates (see types.ts).
 *   2. The extractor SOURCE content hashes — the BACKSTOP: any edit to the
 *      extractor scripts (which emitting a new field necessarily requires)
 *      changes the token, so even a forgotten (1) can't reintroduce the trap.
 *      This is the same mtime-independent, cross-worktree guard the Ruby
 *      manifest already gets for free by keying on `extract-ruby-api.rb`'s
 *      content (which is why the Ruby cache does NOT share this flaw).
 *
 * Tradeoff: input (2) means ANY edit to the extractor scripts — even a comment
 * — busts the whole cross-worktree TS cache, forcing a ~16s re-extract. That is
 * deliberate and matches the Ruby side: correctness over a warm cache during
 * extractor development, and edits to these files are comparatively rare.
 *
 * Constraints: async fs only, no `node:` specifiers, no `process` references.

 * Every per-method field the extractor can emit (mirrors `MethodInfo` in
 * types.ts). Adding a property to `MethodInfo` that the extractor populates?
 * Add its emitted key here too, so the schema token changes and stale cache
 * entries missing the field are evicted automatically.
 *
 * Scope is per-METHOD by construction: entity-level `ClassInfo` fields
 * (`includes`, `extends`, `superclass`, `synthesizedMixin`, …) are NOT tracked
 * here and never have been. An entity-level field only needs its own token
 * input when it can change WITHOUT any per-method field changing; every one
 * added so far has shipped alongside the per-method field its consumer reads
 * (`synthesizedMixin` pairs with `declaredIn`), so registering the method-side
 * key already evicts entries predating the pair. The one exception is
 * `ClassInfo.noRailsEquivalent` (a tag on the class/interface/namespace
 * DECLARATION), which can appear with no per-method field changing; it is
 * covered by input (2) alone — the extractor edit that introduced it changed
 * the source hashes, evicting every entry predating it. Extending the token to
 * entity-level fields is tracked separately — see the
 * `extractor-schema-entity-level-fields` story.
