/**
 * THE MERGE RULE (RFC 0113 open question 3, decided here): project each stream
 * onto its control tokens, then take the multiset difference; only when the two
 * multisets agree does the ORDER of the projection decide. So a pair is
 * `count` (the multisets differ — arms Rails has that the port does not, or the
 * reverse) or `order` (same arms, different sequence), and never both, which is
 * what lets this RFC's `missing-arm` / `invented-arm` and `arm-order` clusters
 * burn down separately.
 *
 * The two rejected options, and why:
 *
 * - **Strict sequence equality over the whole stream.** The interleaved `ref:`
 *   reaches are already the population of RFC 0084 and RFC 0095, so including
 *   them re-reports that debt here and buries the arm signal under it. Worse,
 *   they arrive here with none of the forgiveness the call gate applies to
 *   them: `effectiveTsCalls`' same-file-helper and delegate unions are set
 *   operations that a sequence cannot take WHOLE, so a faithful port that merely
 *   extracts a helper — the single most common false positive the call gate was
 *   built to absorb — would flag on every one of its moved reaches. The
 *   same-file half of that forgiveness IS taken here, at the reach rather than
 *   over the stream: see {@link spliceHelperSkeletons}.
 * - **Multiset equality over the whole stream plus a `reordered` verdict** (the
 *   retired prism-codegen scorer's `matched` / `reordered` split, and
 *   `catalog.ts:skeletonDiff`'s two-directional difference). The verdict split
 *   is the good half and is kept; taking it over the reaches as well is the
 *   same contamination — one call reach moved past another reports as
 *   `arm-order` when no arm moved at all.
 * - **Control-token SUBSEQUENCE only** (option 3 as literally posed). Right
 *   projection, wrong comparison: a subsequence test is directional, so it
 *   answers "does the port contain Rails' arms" and collapses an invented arm
 *   into a pass, or — run the other way — collapses a missing one. This RFC's
 *   clusters need those told apart, so the multiset difference is taken in both
 *   directions instead.
 *
 * Predicate semantics are NOT compared, per this RFC's Non-goals: an `if` is an
 * `if` regardless of what it tests, which is what keeps this out of RFC 0108's
 * territory.
 */
/**
 * `raise-class` is the third verdict (RFC 0113): the two arm multisets agree
 * only once the raised CLASS is erased, so the port raises where Rails raises
 * but names a different error — RFC 0111's "same error class" rows, surfaced
 * here without a second extractor. It is taken AFTER `count` and `order`,
 * which both read the class-erased projection so that this story leaves their
 * row population exactly where it was.
