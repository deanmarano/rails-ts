/**
 * CI gate for the missing-`throw` arm ratchet (RFC 0113). Fails on:
 *
 *   - GROWTH — a gated package's missing-`throw` row count rose above its
 *     committed mark, in the package total or in any one TS file. The fix is to
 *     raise what Rails raises, where Rails raises it, never to raise the mark;
 *   - UNMEASURED — a gated package the run never reported, which would
 *     otherwise disarm the gate silently.
 *
 * A mark left ABOVE the measurement is reported, not failed: narrow it in the
 * same PR that restored the raise with `pnpm parity:api:arms:throws:tighten`,
 * which writes each dimension DOWN and never up. There is no reseed — the same
 * rule the call baselines carry, for the same reason: a whole-file rewrite
 * buries the one row you meant to retire.
 *
 * The other four arm tokens — `if`, `loop`, `try`, `rescue` — are report-only
 * and stay that way: `if` alone is 1,891 of the 2,141 rows and measured 70%
 * non-real. See arm-throw-mark.ts for the stratified noise-floor read this gate
 * rests on, and docs/infrastructure/arm-mismatch-noise-floor.md for the record.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/api-compare/lint-arm-throws.ts            # gate (CI)
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/api-compare/lint-arm-throws.ts --tighten  # narrow marks
 *
 * Run `pnpm parity:api --calls` first so output/call-skeletons.json is fresh.
 *
 * Hard rules: no node:* imports, async fs only, no third-party runtime deps.
