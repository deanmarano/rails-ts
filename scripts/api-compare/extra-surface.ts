/**
 * Surface TypeScript files whose public API has drifted *beyond* their Rails
 * counterpart — the inverse of `parity:api`.
 *
 * `parity:api` reports Rails methods missing in TS. This script reports TS
 * public methods/functions/getters/setters that don't correspond to any
 * Ruby method in the matched Rails file. It's a fact-finding audit so we
 * can prune toward Rails-faithful shape; it never modifies source.
 *
 * Algorithm, per Rails-mirroring package:
 *   1. For each Ruby file, resolve its expected TS file via `rubyFileToTs`;
 *      TS files nothing resolves to are scored separately (step 4b).
 *   2. Collect Ruby methods declared in (or `include`d into) the entities in
 *      that Ruby file — any visibility, since a TS method mirroring a
 *      Rails-private method exists in Rails (a visibility divergence, not
 *      extra surface). Map each to its TS-candidate name set via
 *      `rubyMethodCandidates`, which also resolves `conventions.SKIP`
 *      mirrors (`freeze`, `to_a`, `inspect`) so a TS override is
 *      allowed in the file where Ruby defines the method. Union = the
 *      "allowed" TS name set.
 *   3. Collect public TS names declared in the matching TS file — each
 *      class/module's *own* methods (skipping inherited surface so the
 *      diff measures this file's drift, not its ancestor's), each
 *      class / interface / namespace DECLARATION name, plus top-level
 *      `fileFunctions`. Declaration names are scored on the same footing as
 *      members: step 2 allows every entity name the matched `.rb` declares, so
 *      a faithfully ported class is not extra and a trails-only one is.
 *      Filter out `internal: true` (Ruby private/protected, TS
 *      private/protected, TS `#`-prefixed fields, and `@internal` JSDoc on a
 *      top-level exported function or on a class member — including a
 *      constructor and a computed-name member) and
 *      separately filter `_`-prefixed names — the extractor keeps those as
 *      public exports; the Rails-private convention in this repo means they
 *      should not count toward extra surface.
 *   4. Extra = TS names \ allowed names. Emit per-file, per-package, and
 *      top-N reports.
 *   4b. TS files that NO Ruby file maps onto are scored too, with an empty
 *      allowed set — see `uncoveredTsFiles`. Rails-test-mirroring trees
 *      (`test-helpers/`, `support/`, `cases/`, fixture corpora) are held out
 *      because the Ruby extractor reads `lib/` only, so they could never have
 *      a counterpart.
 *   5. Subtract the reasoned exceptions: a declaration carrying a
 *      `@noRailsEquivalent <reason>` JSDoc tag counts as `Allowed` rather
 *      than extra. Since RFC 0080 the tag is the ONLY such source — the
 *      former extra-surface-allow.json sidecar is gone — and a tag on a name
 *      that no longer flags is STALE and fails the run. The tag is read on
 *      members AND on class / interface / namespace declarations, so an extra
 *      that is a declaration rather than a member has the same inline form
 *      its members do — the declaration name is scored surface (step 3), so
 *      such a tag matches and goes stale like any other. On an `interface` the
 *      declaration tag additionally covers every member — see
 *      `collectTaggedEntries`. A FILE-level tag (a leading JSDoc block above
 *      the imports) covers every extra in its file, but only where the blanket
 *      is sound — see `fileTagVerdict`.
 *   6. Classify each written tag's permanence claim — see `classifyReason`.
 *      Advisory only: the count of tags that never state one is reported so a
 *      batch of new tags is visible, but it does not affect the exit code.
 *
 * Manifests are produced by `pnpm parity:api`; if they're missing the
 * script bails with a hint (same convention as `parity:api:moves`).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   pnpm tsx scripts/api-compare/extra-surface.ts \
 *     [--package <name>] [--top <N>] [--json] [--exclude-glob <glob>]...
 *
 * Each extra is classified as **novel** (the candidate name appears nowhere
 * in Rails-land) or **moved** (Rails defines it, just in a different `.rb`).
 * Files are ranked by novel count primarily — barrel-style aggregators
 * (`connection-adapters.ts`) drop below smaller novel-heavy files like
 * `relation/finder-methods.ts`. `--novel-only` drops moved extras entirely.
 *
 * Flags:
 *   --package <name>      Restrict to one package (e.g. activerecord).
 *   --top <N>             Top-N most-divergent files (default 50).
 *   --json                Emit machine-readable JSON to stdout instead of
 *                         the human report.
 *   --exclude-glob <g>    Skip TS files matching <g> (substring match
 *                         against the TS file path). Repeatable. Useful
 *                         for known-intentional extensions like
 *                         `dx-tests/` or `defineSchema`-only modules.
 *   --novel-only          Drop moved-not-novel extras (filters barrel noise).
 *   --max-detail <N>      Cap names per file in detail listing (default 40).
 *   --verbose             Print the crediting Rails owner of each moved name.
 *   --help                Print this message.

 * `PostgreSQL::SchemaStatements` and ~80 of its names score `moved`. "No
 * counterpart FILE" is not the claim "no counterpart NAME", and `moved` — the

 * rename may be owed. Refusing is a hard failure naming the file, never a
 * silent no-op: a blanket that quietly stopped applying would leave the surface
 * it was absorbing uncounted.
 *
 * `extras` is the FULL scored set, `--novel-only` notwithstanding: a moved name
 * refutes the claim whether or not this run is reporting moved names.
 *
 * A moved name the reason names in its `MOVED-BY-SHORT-NAME:` clause
 * (`declaredCoincidentalMovedNames`) stops refuting it — see that clause for
 * why the escape is per-name and reviewed. The declaration is only-shrink: a

TS files that no Rails file maps onto are scored too, with an empty allowed
set — every public name in them is extra. Trees mirroring Rails' test/ code
(test-helpers/, support/, cases/, fixture corpora) are held out, since the Ruby
extractor reads lib/ only. The NoCntrp column reports that slice separately.

A novel \`interface\` DECLARATION name is exempt by kind and needs no tag: it is a
type-only shape Ruby leaves to duck typing, so no Ruby counterpart is possible,
and its MEMBERS are exempt with it. An interface name that does appear in Rails
stays scored (as moved), members included — that is the drift case a blanket
exemption would hide.

Reasoned exceptions: an extra is allowed by tagging its TS declaration
\`@noRailsEquivalent <reason>\` in JSDoc. Allowed extras are subtracted from the
novel/moved counts and reported as an "Allowed" total; a tag on a name that no
longer flags is STALE and fails the run. A reason opening with PERMANENT or
CONVERGEABLE states its permanence claim; a tag stating neither fails the run.

A whole file with no Rails counterpart can carry ONE reason instead: write
\`@noRailsEquivalent <reason>\` in a JSDoc block at the top of the file, above the
imports. It covers every otherwise-extra name in that file. The claim is checked,
not trusted — if a Rails file maps onto it, or any name in it scores as moved
(the name exists in Rails, just elsewhere), the tag is refused and the run fails.

 * The names a file contributes ONLY as an `interface` declaration — nothing

 * RFC 0080 policy, decided here: an interface declaration name is exempt from
 * extra surface BY KIND, but only when it is also **novel** (the name appears
 * nowhere in the Rails source — the scorer applies that half). The reasoning
 * is the one `collectTaggedEntries` already applies to a tagged interface's
 * members: an `interface` is type-only, and the overwhelming majority of ours
 * exist because TS must write down a shape Ruby leaves to duck typing
 * (`…Options` bags, `…Host` collaborator seams, `…Like` structural stand-ins).
 * A Ruby counterpart is impossible by construction, and the alternative was
 * ~600 near-identical `@noRailsEquivalent` tags, whose sheer volume would
 * drown the tag report the same RFC exists to make readable.
 *
 * The novelty half answers the counter-argument — a TS `interface` is
 * sometimes a real port of a Ruby module's shape, and a blanket exemption
 * would hide that drift. If the name exists anywhere in Rails, the exemption
 * does NOT apply: a `Quoting` or `TypeMap` interface declared in a file whose
 * Rails counterpart doesn't declare it is precisely the misplacement this
 * report is for, and it stays scored (as `moved`) and stays tag-able. Only
 * names Rails never uses at all — which therefore cannot be a drifting port of
 * anything — drop out.
 *
 * The members of an exempt interface go with it — see
 * `collectInterfaceMemberOnlyNames`.
 *
 * Names shared with a member or with a class/namespace declaration are NOT
 * exempt — including the `namespace` half of a declaration-merged
 * `interface`+`namespace` pair, which the extractor collapses into one entry
 * (`declaredAsNamespace`): the extra set is a flat Set of bare names (see `allowKeyOf`), so one
 * name carries one verdict, and exempting on the interface's behalf would
 * silently absolve the non-interface declaration sharing it.

 * RFC 0117, decided here: an `interface` whose declaration name is exempt by
 * kind (`collectInterfaceOnlyNames` — a structural shape Ruby leaves to duck
 * typing) covers its MEMBERS too, exactly as a `@noRailsEquivalent` tag on an
 * interface declaration already does (see `collectTaggedEntries`). The
 * declaration and its body are one statement about one type: if the type
 * itself has no Ruby counterpart by construction, neither does any member of
 * it, and scoring those members against the `.rb` the file happens to mirror
 * is a category error. `Arel::Attributes::Attribute#relation` is typed
 * `RelationLike` in `attributes/attribute.ts`, so its `tableAlias` /
 * `typeForAttribute` — members of `Arel::Table` (`arel/table.rb:26,90`), never
 * of `Arel::Attributes::Attribute` (`arel/attributes/attribute.rb:5-40`) —
 * were reported as `attribute.rb`'s moved surface purely because the stand-in
 * shares its file.
 *
 * The exemption is deliberately NOT unconditional on interface members. It
 * rides on the declaration's verdict, which the scorer applies: an interface
 * named after something Rails uses may be a real port of a Ruby module's
 * shape, so its members stay scored and stay tag-able — the drift case a
 * blanket member exemption would hide.
 *
 * The exemption is deliberately NOT restricted to novel names, as the
 * declaration one is: a structural stand-in's member routinely names a method
 * some OTHER Rails class defines (`Arel::Table#table_alias`), which is exactly
 * the moved row the wrong `.rb` was being charged for.
 *
 * A name anything else in the file also contributes — a class member, a
 * top-level function, any declaration name — is excluded, on the same
 * reasoning as `collectInterfaceOnlyNames`: the extra set is a flat Set of
 * bare names, so one name carries one verdict and exempting on the
 * interface's behalf would silently absolve the other contributor.
 * `interfaceMembers` is what tells the two halves of a declaration-merged
 * `interface`+`namespace` apart — only the names it lists came from the

 * mixin routing exactly:

 *     A nested `include N` inside M chains through (instance methods only).
 *     M's own `extend` chain does NOT propagate to the host — Ruby `extend`
 *     affects only the receiver's singleton class.
 *   - `extend M` (at host level): M's instance methods land as class methods.
 *   - Module `classMethods` are NOT propagated through include/extend (Ruby
 *     semantics; `flattenIncludedMethodInfos` only pushes `instanceMethods`).
 *     The `ActiveSupport::Concern` "class methods via include" pattern is
 *     handled by `foldClassMethodsModules` above, which moves the nested
 *     `ClassMethods` submodule's instanceMethods into the parent's own
 *     `classMethods` — flattening still only reads `instanceMethods`, so
 *     ASC class methods become entity-level surface, not propagated mixins.
 *   - A mixin whose source file is unported (`UNPORTED_FILES`) is skipped, so
 *     its methods never enter `allowed` — matching the `isSourceUnported`
 *     guard at compare.ts:507. The check uses the module's *owning* package.
 *
 * The matched file's `fileConstants` names join `allowed` too (see
 * `rubyConstantCandidates`): a faithfully-ported `ER_DUP_ENTRY` is not extra
 * surface. Constants have no mixin routing — they belong to the file, not to
 * an entity — so they're added once up front rather than per entity. The
 * file's `fileHashKeys` join the same way (RFC 0126): a Ruby Hash key is a
 * Ruby-side name that is not a declaration, so a port spelling it as an
 * object-literal key or an options-interface field is not invented surface.
 *
 * Since `allowed` is a flat name set (instance vs class collapsed on the TS
 * side anyway), we simply union both `instanceMethods` and `classMethods`
 * for the *host* entity, but ONLY `instanceMethods` for walked-into mixins.
 *
 * `include` names are resolved via compare.ts's `resolveModuleName`, which
 * walks namespace prefixes — `AbstractAdapter` including `"Quoting"` maps
 * only to `ConnectionAdapters::Quoting`, never to PG/MySQL siblings of the
 * same short name. Cross-package / stdlib mixins are silently skipped.

 * TS files in the package that no Ruby file maps onto via `rubyFileToTs`.
 * "Ruby file" includes a file the extractor knows only through its file-level
 * constants — `coveredTsFiles` unions those in, so a constant-only Rails file
 * is a counterpart here exactly as it is in the literal pass.
 *
 * Before this, such a file was invisible: the report iterates Ruby files, so a
 * TS file nothing points at was never visited and its whole public surface went
 * unmeasured — neither novel nor moved nor allowed. That is exactly backwards,
 * since a file Rails has no counterpart for is where extra surface is MOST
 * likely (`ar-config.ts`'s 20+ `setX` re-spellings of Ruby `foo=` writers
 * reported zero extras because `active_record.rb` redirects onto `base.ts`).
 *
 * These files are scored with an EMPTY allowed set — there is no Rails file to
 * take allowed names from — so every public name lands as an extra, classed
 * novel vs moved against the package-wide Rails candidates like any other —
 * including the `setX` spelling of a Ruby `foo=` writer, which `rubyMethodToTs`
 * now offers as a candidate after the bare `foo` accessor, so
 * `setProtocolAdapters` lands as a *move* against `ActiveRecord.protocol_adapters=`
 * rather than as novel. The name is still reported; only its classification
 * changed, and it changed because a promise-returning `setX` is the faithful
 * rendering of a Rails writer that blocks on I/O (RFC 0068).
 *
 * An empty allowed set does NOT mean a receipt cannot exempt a name here. The
 * per-declaration `@noRailsEquivalent` check runs BEFORE the novel/moved
 * classification, so a tagged member scores `Allowed` and is subtracted from
 * both dimensions in one of these files exactly as in a Rails-mapped one. The
 * whole rule for a `NoCntrp` file is: every public member counts toward `total`
 * unless it carries its own receipt — its Rails hit count and its novel/moved
 * verdict are not inputs. That is what lets a Ruby-core class ported into
 * `ruby-compat` (`file.ts`, `dir.ts`, `io.ts`, `process.ts`) grow a member per
 * arriving call site without moving the RFC 0117 mark (RFC 0135).
