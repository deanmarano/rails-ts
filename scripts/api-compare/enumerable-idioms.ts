/**
 * Single source of truth for Ruby Enumerable/Comparable idioms whose faithful
 * port is a native JS method spelled DIFFERENTLY. Two api-compare tools consume
 * it (RFC 0025), so it lives here rather than in a copy each keeps in sync:
 *   - compare.ts's call ratchet counts the analogue (`some` for `any?`) as
 *     making the Ruby call, so a faithful port isn't flagged as an omission;
 *   - lint-calls.ts's call-graph lint treats the KEYS as noise — Ruby records
 *     them as calls but the port is a native JS method, not a ported internal.
 *
 * A value lists ONLY the differently-named spelling: the naming-convention name
 * (`rubyMethodToTs`) is already a candidate, so `select` needs just ["filter"].
 * Each alias must be the WHOLE call's analogue, never a building block —
 * `min_by → reduce` would let any reduce silence a dropped min_by, so such loose
 * pairs are deliberately absent. Aliases are consulted only to decide whether a
 * TS body already makes a call; they never widen which Ruby calls count as
 * ported, so adding one can never introduce a new mismatch.
 *
 * NO POSITIONAL/PROPERTY ANALOGUES HERE, and that is a measured decision, not
 * an oversight (RFC 0092 `positional-idiom-analogues`, 2026-08-08). `first` →
 * `[0]`, `last` → `.at(-1)`, `size` → `.length`, `any?` → `.length > 0` are
 * property or index forms, not call names, so they could only be credited
 * through `NO_JS_CALL_FORM` (compare.ts) — which suppresses the Ruby call for
 * EVERY receiver. The evidence against doing that is recorded at that table's
 * "DELIBERATELY NOT suppressed" comment: the one receiver distinction the
 * comparator has (the RFC 0083 inert-receiver filter) is already applied, and
 * zero of the 106 surviving activerecord rows for these names are inert, while
 * several are genuine Relation receivers whose `.first`/`.any?` runs a query.
 * Those rows are handed to the reason-text route instead.
