/**
 * Method-centric API comparison.
 *
 * Compares Ruby Rails API surface with our TypeScript API by matching
 * individual methods, not class/module wrappers. The file IS the module —
 * if Ruby's `Sanitization` module defines `sanitize_sql`, we look for
 * `sanitizeSql` anywhere in the expected TS file, regardless of whether
 * there's a `Sanitization` class/interface wrapping it.
 *
 * This prevents agents from gaming the metric with empty interfaces.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/api-compare/compare.ts \
 *     [--package activerecord] [--missing] [--files] [--incomplete] [--closure] \
 *     [--inheritance] [--arity] [--params] [--public-only | --privates-only] [--calls]
 *
 * `--closure` scopes the per-file detail table to the AR/AM require closure
 * (ar-closure.ts, RFC 0092) and prints its own totals line under the table, so
 * a support-gem burndown sees only the files ActiveRecord/ActiveModel require.
 * Whole-package and Data-layer/AR-closure summaries are unchanged either way.
 *
 * The default reports the full surface (public + private). `--public-only`
 * drops Rails-private/internal methods on both sides for a contract-only
 * view; `--privates-only` is the inverse. The JSON artifact is always
 * written to output/api-comparison*.json regardless of flags.
 *
 * The advisory arity check compares the positional-arg ranges of name-matched
 * methods (it never affects the parity %). A one-line summary always prints and
 * output/arity-mismatches.json is always written; `--arity` adds the
 * per-method breakdown. A justified deviation can be suppressed with a
 * reasoned arity-exclude.json entry (arity-exclude.ts); lint-arity-excludes.ts
 * then fails that entry once it goes stale.
 *
 * The advisory parameter-NAME check (RFC 0126, param-names.ts) runs beside it on
 * the same pairs: where arity asks how many args a method takes, this asks what
 * they are CALLED, since CLAUDE.md makes the camelCased Rails identifier the
 * required spelling. A `params N/M` figure prints next to `arity` and
 * output/ambiguous-parents.json carries the inheritance edges the walk followed
 * to NOTHING, per package and omitting packages at zero, so the file IS the
 * remainder lint-ambiguous-parents.ts gates only-shrink (RFC 0126).
 *
 * output/param-name-mismatches.json is always written; `--params` adds the
 * per-position breakdown. lint-param-names.ts gates it against an only-shrink
 * per-package/per-file mark (param-name-mark.json).
 *
 * Three further advisory checks run on the same name-matched pairs, each
 * one-line-summarized and always written to its own artifact, none affecting
 * the parity %: option-keys (output/options-key-mismatches.json), literal
 * defaults/constants (output/literal-mismatches.json), and — under
 * `--calls` (or `API_COMPARE_CALLS=1`) — call-set parity
 * (output/call-mismatches.json). The last is a coarse body-fidelity
 * signal: Ruby body calls absent from the matched TS body's call-set, admitting
 * every ported call name except `super` and the NO_JS_CALL_FORM names
 * (SIGNIFICANT_CALLS). It is ratcheted by lint-call-mismatches.ts
 * against the split call-mismatches-exclude/ baseline directory (one file
 * per source) — see RFC 0047. RFC 0084 folded the narrow RFC 0044 gate (a
 * curated significant-call allowlist over a second artifact) into this one,
 * whose population strictly subsumed it.
 *
 * Source-hash pinning (RFC 0025): every name-matched pair's normalized Rails
 * body digest is written to output/body-hashes.json, and the summary reports
 * pinned/unpinned counts per package (advisory; parity % unchanged). The pin
 * lifecycle is: port → verify → pin → (Rails bump) → drift report → re-verify
 * → re-pin. A committed manifest (body-pins.json) opts specific pairs in;
 * `tsx body-pins.ts --pin <ruby-file>` (or `--pin-all` for the bulk floor)
 * pins/re-pins them at the current digest, and lint-body-pins.ts (CI gate)
 * fails on DRIFT (pinned digest ≠ current vendored digest — upstream Rails
 * changed) and STALE pins (the method was removed/renamed). The digest is
 * body-only and whitespace/comment-insensitive (extract-ruby-api.rb#body_digest),
 * so pure formatting churn doesn't fire. See body-pins.ts for the full flow.
 *
 * Each host class's expected method set is expanded with the instance
 * methods of every module it `include`s (and class methods of modules it
 * `extend`s), recursively. This catches mixin wiring gaps where the
 * mixin's methods live in a sibling TS file but aren't actually reachable
 * on the host — e.g. arel #814: `Predications` methods existed in
 * `predications.ts` but `NodeExpression` didn't mix them in, so
 * `(node).eq(...)` failed at runtime despite a "100%" compare result.

// `super` is captured by both extractors (extract-ruby-api.rb records
// super/zsuper; extract-ts-api.ts records a bare super(...) callee) and
// significantMissingCalls() has a dedicated, asymmetry-aware branch for it, but
// it is deliberately NOT significant. Rails mixes modules with `include` (Ruby's
// super walks the ancestor chain into the included module), but trails ports
// modules as `this`-typed functions assigned to the class (see CLAUDE.md
// "Module mixins") — there is no class-inheritance `super` to chain to, so the
// omission is structural, not a fidelity gap. The capability is retained for an
// opt-in, curated caller via the `significant` parameter.
//
// Only names the Ruby extractor actually records are useful: its walk_for_calls
// (extract-ruby-api.rb) drops callees starting with `_` or not matching
// /\A[a-z]/, so e.g. `_run_save_callbacks` can never match — the
// non-underscore `run_callbacks` path covers callback dispatch instead.

// The significant set (RFC 0047): admits EVERY ported Ruby call name as
// significant, except `super` (which the module-mixin port structurally drops —
// see the comment above). Computed under `--calls` /
// `API_COMPARE_CALLS=1`, this is a membership predicate rather than an
// allowlist, so `checkCalls` flags every name-matched omission, writing
// call-mismatches.json — gated by its own ratcheting baseline (the split
// call-mismatches-exclude/ dir + lint-call-mismatches.ts). The population
// is ~72% Enumerable/Object/accessor noise (bucket c) plus confirmed equivalents
// (bucket b); the baseline seeds large and shrinks as the per-cluster convergence
// stories land. The existing noise-suppression gates inside significantMissingCalls
// (isPortedWithArgs, mapCall, "TS makes NONE of the mapped candidates") still
// apply, so this is not the raw missing-call diff.
//
// Ruby calls whose FAITHFUL JS port emits no call at all — the receiver is
// consumed by a native language construct (a template literal, a for-of loop, a
// truthiness test, the `in` operator). No entry in JS_ENUMERABLE_ALIASES can match
// one of these in a faithful port, because there is no callee to record: the
// gate would baseline every occurrence forever, diluting its signal exactly the way
// `super` is excluded for (see SIGNIFICANT_CALLS below). These are
// therefore suppressed from the significant set (RFC 0025). Each name is
// justified by the non-call construct it becomes.
//
// A name qualifies ONLY because no JS call form exists at all. There is no
// second group any more: `key?` / `has_key?` sat here because the only JS call
// form was `Map#has` and a ported options hash is an object literal, whose
// membership test was the `in` operator or `x.k !== undefined` — a shape the
// gate cannot tell from a dropped guard. `@blazetrails/ruby-compat`'s `hasKey`
// (the port of `rb_hash_has_key`, `vendor/ruby/hash.c:3671`) is that missing
// call form, so RFC 0129 discharged both entries and the ports call it.
//
// The seven that remain are NOT candidates, and ruby-compat cannot make them
// so: each becomes a language CONSTRUCT with no callee, not a call some package
// could supply. `to_s` / `to_str` are a template literal and implicit String
// coercion; `each` is a `for…of`; `present?` / `blank?` are truthiness tests;
// `catch` is a clause, never a callee (see below); and `synchronize` is a mutex
// acquisition JS has nothing to acquire (see below) — a Ruby `Mutex` is
// deferred by RFC 0129 and is the only thing that could ever revisit it.
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT suppressed — `size`, `empty?`, `first`, `last`: these read as
// plain Array/property idioms (`xs.length`, `xs.length === 0`, `xs[0]`, `xs.at(-1)`)
// but on an ActiveRecord::Relation/association receiver they are real methods with
// query-triggering bodies — `Relation#size` is `loaded? ? records.length : count(:all)`
// and `#empty?` is `loaded? ? records.empty? : !exists?` (relation.rb), `#first`/`#last`
// dispatch to `find_nth_with_limit`/`find_last` (finder_methods.rb; trails ports these
// as `performFirst`/`performLast`). A single global set has no receiver-type
// distinction, so suppressing them would make a TS port that rewrites a relation
// `.first`/`.size` into indexing a preloaded array (dropping the query trigger)
// permanently invisible to the gate — exactly the fidelity gap it exists to
// catch. Same reason `delete` (Map#delete), `merge`, `fetch` — all real JS call
// forms — stay in.
//
// MEASURED, 2026-08-08 (RFC 0092 `positional-idiom-analogues`): the question
// "can the comparator tell an Array/Hash receiver from a Relation/association
// one?" was put to the data, and the answer is no beyond what is already done.
// The comparator's only receiver signal is the extractor's inert-receiver
// filter (RFC 0083 `weakCalls` / {@link dropWeakCalls}), which drops a call
// name when EVERY occurrence in the Ruby body sat on a local variable or a
// literal. It is already applied to the population these rows come from, and
// it has already taken everything it can prove: of the 106 activerecord
// call-mismatch rows for `first`/`last`/`any?`/`size`/`include?`, **zero** are
// weak. What survives is ivars (`@stack.last`, `@inserts.first`), bare
// self-calls (23 of the 36 `any?` rows have no receiver at all), constants and
// method chains — and those same arms carry the real query triggers:
// `scope.first` (`associations/singular_association.rb:52`), `records.first` /
// `records.last` (`relation/finder_methods.rb:584,637`), `target.first`
// (`associations/has_many_association.rb:36`), `group_values.any?`
// (`relation/calculations.rb:223,446`), `default_scopes.any?`
// (`scoping/default.rb:56,157`). An ivar or a reader can hold either an Array
// or a Relation, so no receiver-token rule separates them; the audit's
// token proxy misclassifies in both directions. A property-analogue table or a
// `NO_JS_CALL_FORM` entry for these names would therefore buy ~90 row deletions
// at the price of making a dropped query trigger permanently invisible, so the
// tables are deliberately left alone and those rows go to the reason-text
// route (per-row human review), not to a mechanism. See the matching note in
// enumerable-idioms.ts.

// re-raises anything but the sentinel (`isAbortSignal(e)` — activesupport's
// port of `throw :abort`). A clause is syntax, not a call expression, so the
// TS body emits no callee and no alias could ever match it, however faithfully
// the catch is spelled at the Rails call site.

// `synchronize` is the strongest member of that set rather than a marginal one.
// Every Ruby occurrence is a mutex acquisition — `Mutex#synchronize`,
// `MonitorMixin#synchronize`, or a wrapper that delegates straight to one
// (`queue.rb:80`, `asynchronous_queries_tracker.rb:18`) — and JS has no mutex,
// so a faithful port emits the guarded body with no callee at all. There is no
// TS body that could ever satisfy the call, which is what separates a
// NO_JS_CALL_FORM name from a baselined omission: the gate would otherwise
// carry a row per guarded method forever, with nothing to converge onto.

 * structurally drops or respells it, so its position says nothing.
 *
 * `tsCalls` must be the body's OWN source-ordered call sequence
 * (`MethodInfo.callSeq`), never the delegation/helper-union set: a wrapper
 * resolving in place of the implementation has no meaningful order of its own,
 * which is the `resolvePortFn` cross-file-fallback false-positive class the
 * codegen scorer hit on `relation.rb::computeCacheKey`.
 *
 * Compared over a SINGLE candidate declaration's sequence only — two
 * declarations under one name have no combined order — and the `rubyCalls` /
 * `tsCalls` sequences must both be deduplicated at first occurrence, since a
 * name's position is its first one.
 *
 * Both sequences are recorded in EVALUATION order by the extractors
 * (extract-ruby-api.rb#walk_call_in_order, extract-ts-api.ts#collectCalls):
 * a call's arguments come before the call itself, so a body that hoists a
 * nested argument into a local — which an `await` forces on the TS side —
 * reads as the same sequence as the nested spelling, and only a real
 * reordering flags here.
 *
 * At most one flag per body, naming the first inversion — `order:b,a → a,b`
 * reads "TS calls b before a; Rails calls a before b" — so the row is a stable
 * baseline key rather than a whole-sequence string that churns on every edit.
 *
 * A TS name that carries no position for the call under test is skipped here;
 * the membership check still sees it. Two causes, settled in ONE filter — the
 * union computed below — rather than two overlapping ones:
 *   - two of the body's Ruby calls could both be ported as it, so no position
 *     can be attributed to either ({@link ambiguousTsNames});
 *   - one of the body's Ruby calls is SUPPRESSED by the ported-with-args gate
 *     and the name is the spelling it ports ({@link suppressedCallClaims}), so
 *     the position belongs to a call this check never reaches. That is the
 *     same indivisible-position fact as an ambiguous name, arriving by a
 *     different route: the second owner is invisible to the gate rather than
 *     visible-and-tied (RFC 0106 Open Question 1). `significantMissingCalls`
 *     honours the same claims by withholding them from `tsCalls`.
 *
 * `bodyRubyCalls` is the body's call list BEFORE `dropWeakCalls` — the

 * unresolved (`undefined`) result records nothing rather than pairing wrongly
 * (see ambiguousTsOwner):
 *
 *  1. the Ruby class's own short name
 *     (`ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::NullPool` → `NullPool`), which the
 *     naming rules make the TS class name too;
 *  2. the include graph: Ruby flattens a mixin's methods onto the INCLUDING
 *     class, so the Ruby module never names the TS owner — `FinderMethods#first`
 *     lands in relation.ts, whose `Relation` records `extends: ["FinderMethods"]`
 *     and whose sibling `ExplainProxy` does not (`hosts`, see includeGraphHosts);
 *  3. the SEAT (`OwnerSeat`), for the file that ports both halves of one name:
 *     persistence.ts spells `Persistence::ClassMethods#_update_record`
 *     (persistence.rb:687-692) as the free export and the instance half
 *     (`:900-916`) as `InstanceMethods`, so the class seat is the one owner
 *     that is not the instance seat.
 *
 * Step 3 runs only where the RUBY file poses a seat question — the same name on
 * both the singleton and the instance half. Where every Ruby owner sits on one
 * seat the several TS declarations are not the two halves of anything, and
 * picking one by seat is the mispairing this resolution exists to avoid:
 * time-ext.ts's single `toTime` body answers `Time#to_time`, `Date#to_time` and
 * `DateTime#to_time` alike (RFC 0108).
 *
 *  0. reader vs WRITER. Ruby's `name` / `name=` pair both translate to the TS
 *     name `name` (conventions.ts), spelled as a plain member for the reader
 *     and a `set name` accessor for the writer, so a file holding both declares
 *     the name on two owners. Pairing by name alone let the class's `set`
 *     accessor answer for the Ruby READER — `mime_negotiation.rb:85`'s
 *     `set_header k, v` held to `set formats`'s
 *     `set_header "action_dispatch.request.formats", …` (`:137`), and the
 *     `variant` reader's argument-less `ArrayInquirer.new` (`:100`) held to the
 *     error `variant=` raises (`:96`). Keep only the owners whose writer-ness
 *     matches the Ruby method's, so a writer pairs with the `set` accessor and
 *     a reader never does (RFC 0108). Runs first: the Ruby class's own short
 *     name (step 1) names the class the accessor sits on either way.
 *
 *  4. one BODY declared twice. The trails mixin convention (CLAUDE.md "Module
 *     mixins") exports a top-level function and re-exports the very same
 *     function through a grouping object — `export function toTime()` beside
 *     `export const TimeExt = { toTime }` — so the file's owners are `""` and
 *     `TimeExt` for one body. Where every owner declaring the name records the
 *     SAME call-set the comparison is identical whichever is picked, so pick
 *     one (`callSetOf`; the sorted first, which is the free export). Owners
 *     whose call-sets differ are two bodies and stay unresolved. Equality of
 *     the recorded sets is the whole test, so two genuinely different bodies
 *     recording the same set (both empty, say) also resolve — harmless while
 *     the resolved owner only gates `ambiguousTsOwner` / `ownerRecordsNothing`
 *     and the comparison itself unions the file's declarations (checkCalls),
 *     but a reader that consumed the owner's OWN set would need more here.

 * node — an interface member, an ambient `declare`, an abstract signature). So
 * a missing entry means "this owner is a bodyless DECLARATION", never "this
 * owner's body makes no calls".
 *
 * A bodyless declaration beside the body is the settled trails mixin shape
 * (CLAUDE.md "Module mixins"): `export function forgetAttributeAssignments()`
 * at top level, re-declared on `interface Dirty` so the host types it. The
 * guard's original reading — "the resolved owner records nothing, so compare
 * nothing" — dropped every such pair, 68 of them measured across the compared
 * packages (`activemodel dirty.ts forget_attribute_assignments`,
 * `activerecord relation.ts exec_explain`, `activesupport callbacks.ts

 * cleanly TO the declaration still lands here. The relaxation is therefore
 * exactly the shape left over: the resolved owner is bodyless AND the file's
 * single recorded body is the TOP-LEVEL function (owner `""`).
 *
 * Both halves are load-bearing. Without the marker the test would relax for an
 * owner that has a body the maps merely failed to key. And a single body is not
 * enough on its own: `relation.ts` declares `first` on the `Relation` interface
 * that types its mixins (body in `relation/finder-methods.ts`) and on
 * `ExplainProxy`, whose one-line body is the file's only one — pairing
 * `FinderMethods#first` with it reports `find_nth` / `find_nth_with_limit`
 * missing, the exact mispairing this guard exists to prevent. A CLASS body is a
 * sibling that can stand in wrongly; the top-level function is not any class's

 * `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQL::Quoting` even though both
 * have the same short name. This scoped resolution avoids the false-positive
 * where PostgreSQL-specific methods inflate AbstractAdapter's missing count.
 *
 * A partially-qualified name gets the same walk, keyed on its last segment:
 * `include PostgreSQL::Quoting` inside `module ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters`
 * names `ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQL::Quoting`. With no prefix
 * match it falls back to the verbatim name, which is the top-level reading.
 *
 * If only one FQN matches an unqualified short name, that single candidate is
 * returned regardless of context. When multiple candidates exist,
 * namespace-prefix walking picks the nearest enclosing match; if none of the
 * candidates share a namespace prefix with the context the verbatim name is
 * returned — the top-level reading, matching the qualified-name arm.
 *
 * Returns exactly one FQN, because Ruby's constant lookup binds exactly one:
 * lexical scope, then the ancestry chain, then top-level, then `NameError`.
 * The return type is `string` rather than `string[]` to keep that structural.
 *
 * The ANCESTRY step is deliberately not implemented, on a measurement. Ruby
 * binds `class Sub < Base; include Foo` to `Base::Foo` when `Sub`'s own
 * namespaces do not answer `Foo`, and `ClassInfo.superclass` is on the
 * entities both callers iterate, so the step is buildable. Swept over the real
 * `output/rails-api.json` — every `includes`/`extends` site on every class and
 * module of all 15 packages, 784 sites — 280 resolve to a name absent from
 * `rubyPkg.modules` (the case where a missed binding costs expected surface),
 * and for ZERO of them does a walk up the `superclass` chain, trying each
 * ancestor's namespace prefixes, find a module the lexical walk missed. The 11
 * sites where an ancestor's namespace does answer the name — `Arel::Nodes::In`
 * including `FetchAttribute`, `PostgreSQL::TableDefinition` including
 * `ColumnMethods`, `Rails::Command::CredentialsCommand` including
 * `Helpers::Editor` — are every one of them already bound by the lexical walk,
 * because the ancestor shares the includer's own enclosing namespace. So the
 * step would move no method onto any host, and adding it is unexercised
 * machinery. Same disposition PR #5354 gave the ambiguous-fallback arm below;
 * re-measure before building it, rather than assuming it is still empty.
 *
 * Every consumer of `moduleFqnByShort` resolves through here —
 * `flattenIncludedMethodInfos` (expected surface) and `buildModuleIncluderFqns`
 * (where that surface may be implemented). A broader lookup in either one lets
 * a method count as implemented in a file Ruby's constant lookup never binds.
 * That is why the last arm no longer returns the *whole* candidate list
 * ("original behavior, safe fallback"): safe against false negatives, but each
 * extra candidate donates its methods to the expected surface and its
 * includers' files to the search set, so a wrong one is a false match.
 * Measured over the real manifests, that arm never fired — 26 ambiguous
 * unqualified include sites across all 13 packages, every one resolved by the
 * namespace walk — so dropping it moved no method counts. Same false-positive
 * shape PR #5344 removed from the includer graph, where 21 methods were
 * counting as implemented in files Ruby's lookup never reaches.
 *
 * This is the RUBY side, and it needs no declaring-file hint the way the TS
 * superclass/mixin sites do (`resolveEntityByDeclaringFile`). A duplicated
 * short name here is disambiguated by the enclosing namespace, which is
 * exactly how Ruby itself binds it — `ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQL::Quoting`
 * beats `ConnectionAdapters::Quoting` for a context inside `PostgreSQL::`
 * regardless of which `.rb` either lives in. The TS sites have no namespaces
 * to walk, which is why they need the file.

 *
 * Only the host's *own* `extend` lands as class methods. Ruby `extend`

/**
 * Pick the best candidate sibling TS file for a Ruby file whose
 * expected TS path doesn't exist. Returns the path, or null if no
 * cluster meets all three thresholds:
 *
 * 1. Absolute floor (`MISPLACED_MIN_HITS`, currently 3) — at least
 *    this many of the Ruby file's candidate method names appear.
 *    Filters out 1- or 2-method noise hits.
 * 2. Coverage floor (`bestCount * 2 >= rubyMethodCount`) — the
 *    cluster covers at least 50% of the Ruby file's expected methods.
 * 3. Separation (`bestCount >= secondCount * 2`) — the leader has at
 *    least 2× the runner-up's hits. Without this, a Ruby file whose
 *    methods are evenly scattered across many TS files (generic names
 *    like `name`/`value`/`run`) would arbitrarily latch onto whichever
 *    file iterated first.
 *
 * All three together rule out the `deprecator.rb ↦ migration.ts`
 * pattern observed during development: 3 hits but only 43% coverage
 * and no separation from the noise floor.
 *
 * The package barrel (`index.ts`) is dropped from the vote before any of the
 * three run. It re-exports the whole package, so it contains a candidate for
 * essentially every name and clears all three thresholds whenever a real file
 * would — and then the bucket's methods are compared against whichever
 * same-named symbol the barrel happens to re-export, which is unrelated to the
 * port (PR #6225: `core_ext/object/acts_like.rb` landed on
 * `activesupport/src/index.ts`, so Ruby `Object#as_json` was compared against
 * `TimeWithZone#asJson`). A barrel is a re-export site, never a port location;
 * a bucket that genuinely lives there is spelled out in
 * `RUBY_FILE_TS_OVERRIDES`, which is the direct-match path and does not come
 * through here.
 *
 * A bucket registered in `NAME_COLLISION_CLUSTERS` is dropped before the vote
 * for the same reason the barrel is: its hits are a coincidence of method
 * names, not a port.

 * Cross-file credit — the include chain, the mixin/reopening arms, the umbrella
 * config arm — is gated on this. Those arms all say "the member is ported, just
 * in another file", which is only meaningful when this Ruby file is ported at
 * all. Without the gate a Ruby file with a 0-line port accumulates `matched`
 * from unrelated files that happen to define a TS name equal to one of its Ruby
 * member names — `active_support/execution_wrapper.rb` read as `matched: 2`
 * with no `ExecutionWrapper` anywhere in the tree, and every `helpers/tags/*.rb`
 * bucket read as ~36 matched off the ActionView helper modules. `matched` must
 * mean "a TS member the compare can point at in a file that maps to this Ruby
 * file"; an unmapped file's members are missing, and read as missing.
 *
 * Every credit arm after the same-file direct match is cross-file — the include
 * chain, the mixin/reopening arms, the misplaced-cluster fallback and the
 * umbrella-config arm — so `main` short-circuits all of them to `missing` when

/**
 * Pick the entity a superclass / include-edge short name refers to.
 *
 * TS records both by their BARE short name, and sibling adapter directories
 * declare same-named entities (`SchemaStatements` lives under
 * `connection-adapters/abstract/`, `postgresql/` and `sqlite3/`). The extractor
 * therefore also records the file the name resolved to — `superclassFile` for
 * an `extends` clause, `extendsFiles[name]` for an `include()`/`extend()` edge
 * — and an exact match on it wins outright. `declFile` is absent only when the
 * symbol resolved outside the package's `src` (a dep package, a mixin-factory
 * call), and then we fall back to file-path proximity: most shared leading
 * directory segments with the child, self excluded.
 *
 * Proximity only decides when it actually separates the candidates. Several
 * candidates sharing ZERO leading segments with the child are not ranked at
 * all, and the old `candidates[0]` fallback bound whichever one the extractor
 * happened to enumerate first — order-dependent, silent, and wrong: naming the
 * CSP mixin `Request` (its Rails name) in `http/content-security-policy.ts`
 * flipped `testing/test-request.ts`'s parent off `http/request.ts` and dropped
 * `test_request.rb` from 13 matched methods to 9 with no warning (PR #5405).
 * So an unseparated tie resolves to nothing, the way `includeGraphEntities`
 * drops an edge name that resolves to more than one entity, and `onAmbiguous`
 * reports it (RFC 0126). A tie at a POSITIVE score keeps its winner: those
 * candidates do share a directory prefix with the child, which is the signal
 * this heuristic exists to read; only a tie at zero is pure enumeration order.
 *
 * `declFile` also arrives in two RESOLVED-but-not-here spellings, which the
 * heuristic must not confuse with an absent one (RFC 0126). `external:` says
 * the name bound a TypeScript lib global or a node_modules type, so no package
 * entity is it and the walk follows nothing — silently, because a
 * `class X extends Error` in an ambiguity warning is noise nobody can act on.
 * `pkg:<package>:<path>` says it bound another workspace package, and
 * `packageOf` is what separates that package's `model.ts` from this one's.
 *
 * `isForeign` marks a candidate a DEP package contributed. A dep's path is
 * relative to ITS OWN src dir, so a shared prefix with the child is a
 * coincidence: activemodel and activerecord both port `attribute_methods.rb`
 * to `attribute-methods.ts`, and so with `validations.ts`, `callbacks.ts`,
 * `serialization.ts`, `attributes.ts` and every other file the two gems both
 * carry. Ranking that coincidence lets a dep's same-named entity take the
 * child's parent slot, and the inheritance walk then pools the DEP's method
 * names under the package's identically-named key — where `directMatch` reads
 * them, so a Ruby method this gem does not port reads as matched because the
 * other gem ports a same-named one. A foreign candidate therefore scores zero
 * and wins only when nothing else is in the running, which is the arm the
 * cross-package walk exists for (`AR::Base extends AM::Model`, AR
 * `type/text.ts` extends AM `type/string.ts`).
