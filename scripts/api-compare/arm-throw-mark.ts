/**
 * The missing-`throw` arm high-water mark (RFC 0113).
 *
 * `report-arms.ts` measures every name-matched pair's control-token
 * projections; this is the only-shrink ratchet over ONE stratum of that
 * measurement — the rows whose multiset difference drops a `throw` — on the
 * same contract as the RFC 0126 parameter-name mark, the RFC 0117
 * extra-surface mark and the RFC 0047/0084/0095 call baselines: a committed
 * mark per gated package, CI failing on ANY increase, and `--tighten` — never a
 * reseed — narrowing a mark left above the measurement.
 *
 * Why this stratum and no other. `remeasure-arm-noise-floor-per-token` re-drew
 * the noise-floor sample per token (`report-arms.ts --sample=N --token=…`) and
 * hand-audited every row. The whole population cannot gate (75.0% non-real,
 * n=80) and neither can `if` (70.0% non-real, n=80) — and `if` IS the
 * population, at 1,891 of 2,141 rows. The missing-`throw` stratum is the
 * opposite: all 69 rows read in full, 61 real and 8 lowering artefact, a
 * non-real rate of 11.6% whose 95% interval (4.1%–19.1%) sits entirely under
 * this RFC's pre-committed ⅓ tripwire. A dropped raise is a real divergence
 * nine times in ten. RFC 0095 is the precedent for gating one stratum and
 * leaving the rest report-only.
 *
 * The two artefact classes the audit named are suppressed AT THE SOURCE rather
 * than budgeted here: `throw(:abort)` / `throw(:exception, …)` ported through
 * the settled halt helper folds onto the `throw` construct
 * (compare.ts:TS_CONSTRUCT_SKELETON_NAMES). `if`, `loop`, `try` and `rescue`
 * stay report-only; `parity:api:arms:report` is unchanged.
 *
 * Hard rules: no node:* imports, no process.*, async fs only, no third-party
 * runtime deps.
